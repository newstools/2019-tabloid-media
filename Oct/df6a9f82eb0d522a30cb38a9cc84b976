Member of the board of trustees, Neetu Chetty said the organisation focuses on uplifting the destitute, empowering women and children of abuse, rape victims and more especially working with the anti-human trafficking task team, in fighting human trafficking in South Africa. “The run and walk will be an all day long event, with guest speakers who have stepped up to raise awareness on the prevalence of human trafficking. They will be advising the community on what can be done, to compact human trafficking. “We will also have a number of corporates who have joined this initiative and also organisation founder, Gloria de Gee will touch on gender-based violence. Our special guest speaker is Marcel van der Walt, an expert in the field of human trafficking,” she concluded. The community is urged to wear comfortable shoes and clothes for the run and walk.
