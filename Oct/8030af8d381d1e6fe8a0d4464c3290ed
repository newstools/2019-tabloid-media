An alleged whistle-blower claims his Ottawa home was torched in a revenge attack on Friday after he assisted law enforcement with information regarding robbery suspects who were arrested and are currently detained by police. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) arrived at the scene at approximately 6:28pm and found the informal home engulfed in flames.  With the use of a garden hose, reaction officers contained the fire at the wood and iron dwelling and prevented it from spreading to the main building, according to RUSA head, Prem Balram. “A man arrived on scene and informed RUSA members that he and his family were renting the informal dwelling and were not at home when the fire had started.   He claimed that his home was intentionally set alight after he provided law enforcement with information that led to the arrest of alleged robbery suspects. He believes the suspects’ accomplices torched his home in a revenge attack,” Balram added.He said, “Most of his valuables including R4, 500 in cash and his passport were burnt. Some household items were salvaged by bystanders who arrived at the scene shortly after the fire had started.The fire was extinguished by the eThekwini Fire Department upon their arrival.”
