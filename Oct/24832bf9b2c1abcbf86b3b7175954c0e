Police officers in the province remain enduring in their onslaught on drug dealers as they seize large quantities of illegal substances in KwaZulu-Natal. During multiple raids conducted recently, drug dealers were dealt a huge blow as illicit drugs valued at almost R400 000 were seized. A 45-year-old man was arrested in the Durban CBD after he was caught selling drugs at a taxi rank on Soldiers Way. Provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker said, “Thirty five stones of heroin valued at R6 700, were found on him during the takedown operation. <br />

The scourge of drug abuse has to be fought in a multi- faceted manner if we want to win this war. “We also welcome the sterling efforts of many organisations and NGOs who are contributing towards rehabilitating and educating our youth on the dangers associated with dabbling in illegal substances,’’ he said.
