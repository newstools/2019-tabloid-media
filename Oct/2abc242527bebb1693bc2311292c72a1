Giving tips on how to attract customers, Nair said: “The way you present your second-hand goods is very important. An endless array of products that offer a more sustainable way to consume, based on recycling and saving money is needed by the public. <br />

Go clean out your cupboards and sell off things you are not using. Someone else can benefit from it while you get to make some extra money for the festive season.” For more information on how to book a stall contact Clive Pillay on 061 429 2574. The fleamarket from 9am to 3.30pm is also looking for musicians to perform anytime during the day of the market.
