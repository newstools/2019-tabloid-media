Durban transport operator Tansnat, allegedly owes the eThekwini Municipality over R1m. The bus company has had a contract with the municipality, on a month-to-month basis for the past few years. According to DA councillor, Nicole Graham, the company has an agreement, whereby they are supposed to pay the municipality for certain things every month in relation to the running of the bus service. “The municipality says that the company owes them for depo fees and the cost pertaining to the manufacturing of the tickets. This issue has been going on for a number of years, which is why the amount is increasing every month. The municipality must recover the debt. It should not be allowed to go on and on , ” said Graham. She added that the municipality is over R11b in  debt across the board in different sectors. This is a problem because the municipality often has to borrow money, where this could be used for capital infrastructure, investment and upgrades.There is a fundamental unfairness in the way we treat ordinary residents compared to the way we treat government and individuals with political clout. If you don’t pay your light bill, your lights will get cut off. It’s time to resolve this matter once and for all, ”said Graham. EThekwini Municipality spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, said that Tansnat’s debt is sub-judice and the court has appointed an arbitrator to preside over this matter. “The debt is staff related expenses as well as SARS and vehicle lease charges. The municipality will have to await the outcome of the arbitration prior to embarking on any further action,” said Mayisela.
