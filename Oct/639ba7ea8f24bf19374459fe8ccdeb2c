Eco-activist and Durban resident Victoria Soutar, was recently announced third princess at the recent Miss Earth Ambassadors event in Johhanesburg. Soutar said it was an incredible experience. “I started off quite nervous but by the end of day one, I felt right at home after meeting the rest of the Miss Earth SA finalists. It was lovely to work with like-minded, strong women who are eager to make a difference,” she said. “It was my first time taking part in something of this nature. It was nothing short of an incredible experience and learning curve. Being in one room with Miss Earth South Africa finalists for 2019/2020 and our lovely Miss Earth SA 2019 Nazia Wadee, as well as some of the other finalists and winners from previous years,  created a special atmosphere on the day,” added Soutar. Currently studying for her Masters in Agricultural Science at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Soutar said,“I look so forward to working with the Miss Earth South Africa team. I have no doubt that this is the start of a lifelong friendship.” <br />

Their time is now.”
