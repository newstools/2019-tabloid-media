The fastest woman in the world in 2019, Kenya’s Sheila Chepkirui, lived up to her billing as the race favourite for the 2019 FNB Durban 10K CITYSURFRUN. The race took place  on Sunday, 13 October, where Chepkirui took four seconds off the South African All Comers Record to win in 30:55. On the men’s front, Stephen Mokoka finally was able to win a 10km race on home 
soil when he took control of the race with 2km to go.This was a surprise as Makoka just recently participated in the World Marathon Championship, taking fifth position. At the press briefing held on Friday, in preparation of the race, Makoka said he would see how fast his legs could go. Mokoka said he was happy with the win. “I am happy, not with just the win and being the first South African, but also with my fastest time in South Africa. Previously, it was 28:18. So that shows that things are coming together for me.” <br />

Chepkirui was bullish and confident on the starting line making it clear that she was here to run fast, and the gusting wind was not going to deter her. “I am really happy with my performance, especially the fast time, this is my first road race in South Africa,” said Chepkirui. Chepkirui said she was not a front runner. “I usually stay at the back in the beginning and then make my move closer to the race finish,” she added. <br />
