Margate police, the Ramsgate Community Policing Forum and security companies in the towns and surrounding areas have condemned the raping, killing and abuse of women and children. The participants distributed pamphlets which read  ‘NO’ to Gender-Based Violence at shopping malls and other places. They also displayed placards which said ‘Enough Is Enough’, ‘Stop Domestic Violence and Abuse’, ‘Stop It While You Have A Voice’, ‘Love Shouldn’t Hurt’, ‘Break The Silence’ and ‘Lets Stand Together.’
