Tracey Hartley from the Feral Cat Rescue, has urged  pet owners to insert a chip on their pets. This step will help organisations like Feral Cat  Rescue to contact the owner if a cat is missing. Since a healthy ginger cat was found by a resident in uMhlanga and did not have a chip for the owner to be traced, the good Samaritan took the cat to a vet, where he is currently being kept. According to Hartley, a chip would have made it easier to identify the pet owner’s name and other details , which is useful if an animal is lost. ” We encounter incidents like this from time to time. We  have to sterilise and try to home other dumped cats. I have had to home about nine cats in the last month,” said Hartley. The Feral Cat Rescue deals with many cases each week, and needs assistance in finding book sales volunteers for two markets in uMhlanga on a Tuesday and Wednesday morning. The volunteer should have their own transportation. In addition to this, the non-profit organisation is also in need of a room for recused cats. “To continue trapping and sterilising the feral cats I catch each week, I need a place to keep them after their operations. This will give them time to recover before we release them. “I will be grateful to a resident in uMhlanga for use of their garage or other room,” said Hartley.
