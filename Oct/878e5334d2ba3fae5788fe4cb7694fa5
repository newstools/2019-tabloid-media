There’s a buzz in the air at Isipingo SAPS with the ushering in of the new station commander, Colonel Matthysen and the new Vispol commander, Lieutenant Colonel Nene, who are cracking the whip on criminals in the area. Speaking to the Southern Star, Isipingo SAPS communications officer, Captain David Ragavan, said, “Colonel Matthysen is zealous about fighting crime and took to the Isipingo CBD, recently, with great gusto together with a contingent of police members from various departments, Metro Police, CPF members and security officers to swoop on criminals. “The crime-fighting teams infiltrated the Isipingo CBD and 10 arrests were effected. Nine suspects were arrested for drug possession while one suspect was arrested for dealing in drugs.” “Police seized 100 capsules of whoonga, 109 grams of dagga, a gas pistol and 51 cartons of illicit cigarettes,” added Ragavan. <br />

He has built a strong relationship with his management team at SAPS Isipingo and has made known his intentions in preventing crime. He loves being on the ground and the strategies he has employed to help combat crime in the area are yielding positive results,” Ragavan said. “Lieutenant Colonel BE Nene who hails from SAPS Umkomaas has crossed over to SAPS Isipingo to reduce crime in the area. While also filling the role as station commander at SAPS Umkomaas, Nene has a wealth of experience to help tackle crime. He has great leadership qualities and together with Matthysen, we have formidable heads leading our police members as a force to be reckoned with in the Isipingo policing precinct,” Ragavan added.
