They married this month and did not accept any wedding gifts. Instead, Durban couple James Rycroft, 36, and his wife, Toni, 37, have urged those who wanted to give them gifts, to donate the funds to Rhodes University to settle outstanding student fees. The couple, former Rhodes University students, tied the knot in Southbroom on the KZN South Coast. They said a close friend, Natasha Joseph had inspired them to assist cash strapped students. “Natasha has been doing the same annually in lieu of birthday presents. Earning a degree is often a key life moment for a young person. We felt strongly in helping students to realise their dreams, ” said Rycroft. His wife said earning a degree should not be inhibited by one’s inability to pay one’s university fees. <br />

The vice chancellor at Rhodes University, Dr Sizwe Mabizela, in a letter to the couple, welcomed the “profound gesture.” He said: “This has impacted me deeply. It proves, once again, the calibre and well-roundedness of our graduates. At a time when young couples would normally and naturally only think of their own comfort and improving their lives, they have both actioned a social purpose and are living proof of our alumni.”  Rhodes University in an email to The Springfield Weekly Gazette confirmed that it is handling the donors funds.
