The celebrations are marked with lighting of lamps, gifts, sweet meats and a colourful display of fireworks. As the Festival of Lights dawns, may every home celebrating this auspicious occasion be blessed with love, joy and sweet memories. The youth from the Caneside Durga Mahima Mundil joins the management and staff of The Phoenix Tabloid in wishing all Hindus a magical, safe and prosperous Diwali 2019.
