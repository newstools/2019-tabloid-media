A 58-year-old woman escaped death and sustained serious injuries after a wall collapsed on her at her home on Nirvana Road in Ottawa on Sunday. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) arrived at the property at approximately 1:14pm and found the woman covered in building material. RUSA head, Prem Balram, said, “It was established that the homeowner was in the process of renovations when a newly constructed wall collapsed on the woman who was seated in one of the rooms. She sustained severe injuries and was stabilised on scene by paramedics before being transported to hospital by ambulance.”
