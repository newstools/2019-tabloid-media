A 37 year-old man was arrested after heroin worth an estimated R4 million was seized at a Ballito residence. The drug haul was made on Friday during an intelligence driven operation led by the Hawks’ Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) together with Crime Intelligence, Durban Metro Police Drug Task Team and Shongweni K9.   The arrest came after the Hawks received a tip off about drugs from overseas that were distributed out from an unoccupied upmarket townhouse in Zimbali.  According to the Hawks report, the suspect was renting another townhouse not far away from  the alleged stash house and used the other apartment as a storage facility. The suspect was confronted and he allegedly put up a fight but he was contained. The team managed to seized 16 kilograms of heroin powder, cash, other paraphernalia and machinery totalling at least R4 m. The team proceeded to his other houses in Umhlanga and Mount Edgecombe. Both yielded no positive results.
