The suspect appeared in the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker,said “Employees at the store were at work when four men entered the shop. Two of them stood guard at the door while the other two approached the employees posing as customers. They allegedly threatened employees with knives and stole a number of cellphones before they fled the scene on foot. “Local police officers were alerted to the robbery and a description of the suspects. The police officers launched a thorough search of the escape routes and a man fitting the description was spotted. He was arrested after a bag containing the stolen cellphones was found in his possession.” The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula welcomed the arrest and praised the police officers for their swift response. <br />

We are appealing to citizens to refrain from buying stolen goods and to report those that buy or sell stolen property to police,” he said.
