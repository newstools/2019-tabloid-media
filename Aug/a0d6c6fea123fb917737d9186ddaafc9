A Brookdale homeowner who fatally shot an armed housebreaker who was in the process of breaking into his Tweedbrook Place residence, on Tuesday, faces a charge of murder whilst police also investigate a case of attempted housebreaking and pointing of firearm. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo, said, “On Tuesday, at 3am, the complainant was asleep at his residence on Tweedbrook Place when he heard someone trying to break into his premises. He woke up and noticed two unknown men trying to enter the house through the window. As the complainant went to investigate to see what was happening, one of the suspects pointed a firearm at him. Before the suspects could do anything further, the complainant fired one gunshot in their direction. As a result, one of  the suspects was shot and fell. The other suspect on seeing his friend shot, fled the scene. “The police were contacted and when Constable S Ramsroop attended, he was confronted by the complainant who pointed out the suspect lying on his back bleeding from his head. At the time, the suspect was breathing heavily and grasping for breath. A few minutes later, the ambulance arrived and declared the said male deceased. A case of attempted housebreaking, pointing of firearm and murder is being investigated by the police. No arrest have been made as yet as the matter will be sent to the prosecutor for a decision to be made,” said Cpt Naidoo. Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said, “Residents are under siege of brazen and ruthless criminals. Sadly, criminals are running riot in the community and residents are trying their best to protect their families and their homes. Residents are urged to invest in adequate security measures and have panic alarms for emergency situations where their security has been breached.”
