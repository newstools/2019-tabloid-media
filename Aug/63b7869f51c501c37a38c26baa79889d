The Ladysmith High School Choir ended their evening on a high note after they scored a whopping 92 percent merit at the Eisteddfod for High Schools’ Choirs that was held in Harrismith last week. The LHS choir rendered three songs in different genres, including “Die Here is my Herder”, “Sound of Silence” and “Kwela-Kwela/Mosadi o Moplia So”. “The adjudicator was amazed at the choir’s performance and gave comments as excellent and outstanding,” said Acting Principal Hugh Clark. This was the third consecutive year that the school achieved this honour. The school governing body, teachers and staff congratulated the choir on their achievement and gave each member a delicious sweet victorious doughnut to celebrate their outstanding performance. “I’m extremely proud of each and every choir member,” said Clark who cherished the celebrations with his charges.  “The proof is in the tasting. We live and sing according to the school’s motto ‘Per ardua at Alta’ that means ‘through hard work, great heights are reached’,” added Clark.
