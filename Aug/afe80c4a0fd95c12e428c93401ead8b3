you are listening to them, it helps. A woman expresses the emotional side of her story, rather than the factual side. All you have 
to do is listen, you might not have the answers but just sit and understand what is the 
most painful part of her story and as they 
try to process the story, it makes them feel better. Camryn Botha

Whether it’s the stereotypical woman or the quirky girl, by not tearing them down you are automatically supporting and empowering them. Nontokozo Ndlovu
