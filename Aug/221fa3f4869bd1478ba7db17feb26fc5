The manufacturing of the R3.5 million cremator for Mobeni Heights Crematorium is underway in America, according to eThekwini’s Cemeteries and Crematoria Division. Development manager for the division, Linda Ntuli, said the cremator is being manufactured in the USA as the department requires certain specifications. Ntuli said the cremator will take 18 weeks to be manufactured, eight weeks to ship from the USA to South Africa and a further two weeks to install and commission. He said: “We are anticipating that they will yield what the department requires in terms of specifications and deliverables.” Ntuli said the cremator, which is more advanced than the old one, is estimated to be ready by February 2020. The news comes as the city has embarked on a clean-up campaign and restoration of cemeteries within eThekwini including Chatsworth. The trimming of grass and bushes has already commenced in some parts of the city. The deputy head for Parks, Leisure and Cemeteries Unit, Sibusiso Mkhwanazi said it is their duty to prune trees, remove rubble, mend as well as replace broken fences in cemetery facilities. He said: “As a caring city we care for residents not only when they are alive, but also in their resting place. Our staff maintain the cemeteries and remove all litter which includes beer bottles that gets thrown by mourners during funerals. We have since intensified such operations because we want to ensure that our cemeteries are in a neat and acceptable state at all times.”
