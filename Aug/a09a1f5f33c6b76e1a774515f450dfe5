Newcastle wheelchair tennis quad ace, Lucas Sithole continued his climb in the world rankings after winning the Belgian Open singles title in Jambes, Belgium recently. He took home the crown after beating top seed, Sam Schroder from the Netherlands in a breathtaking three 
set showdown. The two time Grand Slam champion demonstrated strength and endurance as he twice came from behind to win 1-6, 7-6(3), 6-4. “I have been working very hard and it’s exciting to see it is now paying off. The goal is to break back into the top three in the world, so I will keep at it,” commented Sithole, who is ranked seventh in the singles and eighth in the doubles rankings. “I will return home to work on areas that need attention with the main focus being on the September events in the United States,” said Sithole.
