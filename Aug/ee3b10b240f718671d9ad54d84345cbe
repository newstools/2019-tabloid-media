The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), was ranked one of the top four best universities in South Africa, and in the top 500 globally. The university was ranked by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR).
 
CWUR is a leading consulting organisation providing policy advice, strategic insights, and consulting services to governments and universities to improve educational and research outcomes. “We are extremely proud that UKZN has maintained its position as one of the top four universities in South Africa according to the latest Centre for World University Rankings,” said Professor Deresh Ramjugernath, UKZN deputy vice-chancellor of research. “Our ranking at 424 globally in terms of research performance is an indication of our research standing not just in South Africa, but also recognition as a top research-led university on the continent and globally. One of the indicators used in the Centre for World University Rankings is the employment profile of our alumni. In this indicator, UKZN was ranked 267 globally, indicating the impact that our alumni are making in industry, business, private sector, government, and civil society,” said Ramjugernath.
