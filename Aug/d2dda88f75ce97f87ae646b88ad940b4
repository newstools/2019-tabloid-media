Respect women, stop the abuse and treat them as equals. This was the message from Acaciavale Primary School pupils who commemorated Womensâ€™ Day with a march through town. Teachers, staff and pupils all participated in the event. They bore posters calling for justice against women abuse as well as paying homage to the women of South Africa.
