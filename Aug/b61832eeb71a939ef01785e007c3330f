A very chilled hippie-like 50th anniversary Woodstock concert is happening at the Nelson Mandela Community Youth Centre in Chatsworth on Saturday, 17 August at 5pm. Woodstock, one of the most iconic music concerts happened in New York 50-years 
ago when musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Joe Cocker, Janis Joplin and many others performed. Over 400 000 people attended Woodstock in 1969. This fundraising concert will also pay tribute to Johnny Clegg, a great South African musician who passed away recently. The outdoor concert has already secured an impressive line-up of local bands influenced 
by music from Woodstock. Kumaran Naidoo, one of the organisers of the concert, was upbeat about the exciting evening of good rock music. “We have up to seven bands playing at our concert, with a few acoustic musicians and folk singers. Bands will play their best covers and at least one song from Woodstock. “In between bands, there will be scenes from the original Woodstock concert shown on a big digital screen. Dress up like a 60’s hippie flower child and come enjoy some great music,” Naidoo said. Tickets for the concert are R50 and can be obtained from the youth centre or BP Chatsworth garage opposite the Chatsworth Stadium. You can bring your blankets, picnic baskets, braai stands and cooler boxes for a great evening of good music. For more information contact Clive Pillay
