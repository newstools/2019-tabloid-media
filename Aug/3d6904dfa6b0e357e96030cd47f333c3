The Sunflower Fund is inviting schools to enter its Schools Competition. The competition requires schools to get involved in celebrating Sunflower Day, and the top three winning schools will win a share of more than R30 000 worth of prizes which includes cash and vouchers. The  fund initiated their annual Sunflower Day campaign 16 years ago to get individuals involved in the fight against blood diseases. The campaign, which is anchored by the sale of the Tube of Hope (TOPE), a multi-purpose accessory, is aimed at raising funds for the recruitment of blood stem cell donors to give hope to patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases like cancer. To enter, schools need to sign up via the website  and click on the Schools Competition tab. The competition closes on  20 September. Submissions will be evaluated by a judging panel based on the number of topes bought in relation to the number of learners at the school and ‘Gees’ displayed by school in their celebrations on the day.The fund pays for the cost of the DNA test to register a donor, which costs R3100 per donor. All funds raised through the campaign goes towards these costs. Topes are currently on sale, retailing for R30. The tope comes in six vibrant colours each symbolising hope. “Hope tags are a series of hash tags that will be used throughout the campaign as labels that unite and empower us rather than the divisive labels that society has become accustomed to,” said Kim Webster, head of communications at The Sunflower Fund.
