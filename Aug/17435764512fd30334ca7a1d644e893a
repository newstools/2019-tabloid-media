Phoenix police are searching for a body after what is believed to be a human hand was found by a stray dog in Longcroft, earlier today. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the Blue Security Response Officer arrived at the scene where a stray dog had picked up what appeared to be a human hand in some bushes in the residential area. “A resident in the area spotted the stray dog with what appeared to be a human hand in its mouth and alerted us to the scene. Our officer immediately responded to the scene and the SAPS 10111 call centre was notified of the incident. Detectives from the Phoenix SAPS responded and took over the scene. Police are now searching the area for a body. Community members who may have any information surrounding the incident have been asked to come forward to assist the police in solving the case,” he said. According to Mathios, the hand was badly decomposed and it is unconfirmed at this stage if the deceased is male or female. “Police are thankful that the dog made the gruesome find as now the search can begin for the body and possibly solve a crime or locate a missing person,” Mathios said. Anyone with any information that can help police with this case is urged to contact Phoenix police station on 031-508-8300. Contact police if you have a family member or friend missing.
