The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education spokesperson, Muzi Mahlambi was unerring in his response to the chaos which unfolded at Roseville Secondary School in Umzinto, recently, stating that ‘there is no way we can allow such chaos in our schools. Roseville Secondary pupils grabbed headlines when they staged a protest and refused to attend classes citing various grievances with their demand for an hour long smoke break, sparking much fury. They demanded for a designated smoking area, a matric dance, and listed other grievances. Due to the ongoing ruckus at the school, the doors were closed and pupils missed two exam papers. A meeting was convened with parents to discuss the matter. Responding to the pandemonium at the school, Mahlambi said, “We are the Department of Education. We teach pupils good health. Knowing the dangers of smoking, we cannot expose the pupils to a  hazardous environment.” Provincial education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said in media reports, “We are not going to be held to ransom by the pupils. They are supposed to be in class learning, and we will not negotiate with them. They cannot tell us how to run a department. We are not going to allow this kind of behaviour at schools.” We do not promote such behaviour from our pupils and we stand firm against anyone who does this.” “Last week,  Umzinto police were dispatched to the school, after about 400 pupils blockaded the entrance to the school with trees and logs. Through police intervention, they were dispersed. According to Mahlambi, teaching and learning has resumed at the school.
