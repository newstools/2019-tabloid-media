In celebration of Women’s Month, Cindy Norcott of Pro Talent encourages women to reflect on what they have overcome in their struggle to be recognised as equals in society. “It is a time to celebrate the lengths women have gone to in order to fight for equality. For most of us though, these fights seem foreign and distant and for many women, Women’s Day might not have a personal meaning beyond having a public holiday to enjoy,” says Norcott.   Norcot says she believes that women can learn more from the questions they ask than from the comments they make. “Here are my top 10 questions that I believe can have an impact on women this Women’s Month, to remind them of the power that they have to change the world in which they live,” adds Norcott. “I hope that some of these questions resonate with you and challenge you to help uplift another woman this Women’s Month in your own unique way,” concludes Norcott.
