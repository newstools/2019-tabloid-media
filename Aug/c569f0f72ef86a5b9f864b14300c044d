Following a march by scores of students from the Durban University of Technology (DUT) and the Economic Freedom Fighters’ student command to Durban City Hall on Monday, calling for the case of slain DUT student Mlungisi Madonsela to be reopened, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has promised to review the decision to close the death investigation. Madonsela, 21), was shot in the crossfire between authorities and protesting students at DUT in February where it was alleged that a security guard from a private security company fired the shot that struck Madonsela. He died in hospital. Citing a lack of evidence in the case, in June, the NPA said it would not prosecute the security guard and closed the case. Marching students cried out for justice for Madonsela six months after his death and handed over a memorandum to NPA officials demanding that the case be reopened and the perpetrators face the long arm of the law.According to media reports, Madonsela’s sister, Sibongile Mgenge has called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to share the same sentiment as he applied in the Senzo Meyiwa murder case and prioritise her brother’s case.
