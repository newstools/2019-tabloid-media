Durban Metro Police spokesperson, Parboo Sewpersad, has called on members of public to help police weed out corrupt police members by refraining from handing over cash in the way of bribes and rather reporting the matter to police authorities. This plea comes after a Durban Metro policeman and a Phoenix SAPS policewoman who is seconded to the eThekwini Outer North Cluster were arrested for allegedly stealing gaming chips to the value of R100 000 from Sibaya Casino. According to reports, the duo were arrested whilst entering into their vehicle, which was allegedly reported to have been involved in a crime in the Bellair area in 2016. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said, “Durban North police arrested two suspects in their 40s for theft and possession of suspected stolen property.” She said the suspects were set to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court last Thursday.” Supt Sewpersad confirmed that a 36-year-old policeman based at the Outer West unit had been arrested. Meanwhile, Sen Supt Sewpersad said two Metro policewomen also face bribery charges and are out on R500 bail after demanding a R200 bribe from a motorist in the Durban CBD, recently.Sewpersad said, “Police were alerted to the criminal activity of the Metro officers by the motorist. The suspects were promptly arrested. We will not tolerate rogue police officers and criminality within our law enforcement department. We are on a mission to eliminate such errant behaviour. We urge members of the public to refrain from offering police officers bribes or ‘Coke money’ so to speak. We are investigating both incidents internally and disciplinary processes will follow.” The arrests come in the wake of the three policemen and a policewoman stationed at Inanda SAPS who were charged with kidnapping, extortion, pointing of a firearm, theft of a cellphone and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, recently.
