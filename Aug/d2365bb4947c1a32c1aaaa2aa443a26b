Gauteng-based Salaam Peace Foundation in partnership with Colours of Hope (COH) made a return visit to Jobstown Primary School in Madadeni on Tuesday, 6 August, to present pupils with school shoes. Intervention came after COH identified the school as a worthy recipient in need of assistance. They then made contact with Salaam Foundation who conduct the annual #Riding4SAeducation fundraising cycle campaign. The first visit to the school in January of this year saw the organizations pledge to aid the school. “True to their promise they returned to the school in March where they donated much needed stationery to learners,” said a CoH spokesperson. “But the promise did not end there. Salaam Peace Foundation and COH returned yet again last week much to the jubilation of the principal, staff and learners and donated brand new school shoes to the young learners. This shoe delivery was as a result of the Foundation’s latest fundraising campaign #climbing4SAeducation,” said the spokesperson.
