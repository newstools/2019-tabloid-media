Fawzia Peer, African National Congress veteran and loyal cadre, has confirmed her resignation as deputy mayor from the eThekweni Municipality, effective 29 August. This comes after Peer’s removal by the Provincial Executive Committee along with former eThekweni mayor Zandille Gumede, Speaker William Mapena and chief whip Neli Nyanisa, two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Peer has distanced herself from an online petition that was generated by her loyalists calling for her reinstatement as deputy mayor. They said in the petition that her recalling “illogical, unjustified and unfair”. Peer said that she was “not in any way affiliated with”, nor does she “endorse” the petition. She also said that she distances herself from the WhatsApp group created in support of her and the comments therein. She said that she remained a “disciplined cadre” of the ANC and “accepts any and all of its resolutions regardless”. Peer confirmed that she tendered her resignation saying that she looks forward to her redeployment “wherever that may be”. Supporters wait anxiously to hear what is next for the ward 31 PR councillor.
