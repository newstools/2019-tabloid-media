A hijacked Isipingo couple narrowly escaped death on Thursday when hijackers showed intent to kill them, but their lives were thankfully spared when the suspect who was driving the hijacked vehicle intervened and said that they should be released. The couple were reportedly watched by the hijackers when they arrived on Acalypha Crescent in Lotus Park and were accosted as they were about to enter their vehicle after a pitstop at a relative’s house. Isipingo SAPS communications officer, Captain David Ragavan, said, “Three suspects accosted the couple as they were about to enter their vehicle, a silver VW Polo which was parked on the roadside. “One suspect pointed a firearm at the couple. The suspects searched the duo and took their cellphones, watches, laptops and vehicle. “The husband and wife were forced into the vehicle by the suspects and were dropped off in uMlazi, unharmed.” Ragavan said a carjacking case is being investigated by Isipingo SAPS. According to information received from a well-informed source, two of the suspects were keen on shooting the victims but the driver quickly intervened and suggested that they be dropped off. “The victims were dropped off at Y-section in uMlazi where a passerby assisted them to contact a family member for help. The couple was visibly traumatised and are thankful to be alive after that horrific ordeal,” the source said.
