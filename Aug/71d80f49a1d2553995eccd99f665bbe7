The taxi fare increase announcement was met with widespread protest action last week. It was not all good news for commuters as the Klipriver Taxi Association announced a 12.5 percent increase as of 1 August. Protestors took to the streets in Roosboom, on the R103, with Bluebank, Burford and Driefontein all barricaded. Angry commuters claimed that the increase in the fare was unaffordable and that taxis were not roadworthy to transport passengers. They said that the taxi association should stop hiring private security guards to watch over them. According to the Klipriver Taxi Association this was annual increase as the national increase on taxi fares was already implemented. Commuting will cost passengers R1.50 more when travelling to work or school. “We have had several meeting with community leaders and councillors, including the Alfred Duma Municipality, to ensure that people of Ladysmith are well informed about the increase,” said the association. In an interview with the Ladysmith Herald the taxi association said that annual increases was necessary as salaries, petrol and all other expenses impacted on it. “We have engaged with everyone to properly inform the community. This is the increase that the association and community have decided upon. The association did put forward an increase of 25 percent, but listening and talking to community the increase was kept at 12.5 percent. We have an open door policy for all our commuters, leaders and members of the community and we would like to express that we are here to listen to any problems that can arise,” said the association.
