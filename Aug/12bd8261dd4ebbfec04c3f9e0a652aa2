A business robbery suspect was trapped like a cat on a hot tin roof and abandoned by his gang of accomplices when response officers dashed quickly to the scene of a burglary in progress at a business premises in Umbilo, on Sunday night.Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios said the armed response officer responded to an alarm activation at a property in the area when members of the public advised him that they had spotted a gang of suspects breaking into another business premises at around 10.15pm.“Our armed response officer immediately called for backup and proceeded to the premises where two of his officers arrived to assist him at the scene,” Mathios said. “The officers spotted one suspect standing on the ledge of the roof and they ordered him to get off the roof. When he jumped off the roof, one of our officers arrested him and handed him over to a member of the Umbilo SAPS,” he said. Mathios said that upon further investigation, it was established that the suspects had arrived at the business premises in a white bakkie.“The suspects had robbed the onsite security guards at the premises of their cellphones before ordering them to lie down on the ground. The suspects then used an extendable ladder to climb onto the roof to gain entry into the premises. “They then grabbed goods from the premises and threw them off the roof before they were spotted by members of the public. “The suspects then fled the scene in their vehicle, leaving the goods lying on the road and one suspect standing on the roof,” he said.The recovered goods were handed over to the Umbilo SAPS. Mathios commended the team work of the members of the public and the officers which led to the arrest and the recovery of the goods. “We commend the members of the public who took the time to report this incident to our officer which enabled him to swiftly respond to the scene of the crime,” he said.
