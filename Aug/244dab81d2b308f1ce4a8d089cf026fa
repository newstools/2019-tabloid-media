Buying stolen property is viewed in a serious light and guilty parties will be arrested and prosecuted. This was the sentiment shared by Wentworth SAPS Acting Vispol Commander, Captain Houston, following the arrest of four suspects in Woodville Road, Wentworth, recently. Communications officer at Wentworth SAPS, Captain MP Gumede, said, “The members of Vispol from the station were conducting crime prevention duties, when they spotted a white VW Golf parked near the flats under a tree. The members in attendance were Captain Houston, Captain Gumede and Reservist Khan. The vehicle was approached and four males jumped out in an attempt to flee. “The officers warned them to stop by shouting at them. The males were searched but nothing was found on them. “The car was searched and three laptops were seized. They were questioned about the possession of the laptops but failed to give satisfactory answers or prove accountability. The suspects were detained at Wentworth SAPS and charged for possession of suspected stolen property.” Houston said, “Whoever receives suspected stolen property or property stolen from or acquired  it from business premises or residential premises will be arrested and charged for possession or receiving suspected or stolen property in terms of Section 36 and Section 37 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Members of the community must refrain from being in possession of or receiving any stolen or suspected stolen property. Those arrested will be dealt with accordingly in court.” Members of the public are urged to contact the Crime Stop number 08600-10111 or 10111 to report theft.
