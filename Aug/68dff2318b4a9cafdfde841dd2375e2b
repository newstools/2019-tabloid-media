The community has been left angered after the remains of a burned dog was recovered on Dry Road. Early morning commuters were greeted by the charred body of what is believed to have been a stray. According to some motorists travelling along the road, several calls were made to the municipality to remove the remains but the municipality only reacted after a few days. Anna-Marie Koen of the Ladysmith Animal Anti-Cruelty League confirmed that calls were also made to the shelter, however they were not responsible for picking up dead animals. “It is sad to see the animal there and nothing was being done about it,” said one of the motorists.
