Three people died after a horror collision on the M7 underneath the N2 bridge on Sunday evening, 4 August. Rescue Care’s Garrith Jamieson said paramedics arrived on the scene to find that a bakkie was T-boned by a truck at the intersection. “The bakkie had five occupants with some seated at the rear of the vehicle. “These patients were ejected and had sustained multiple injuries.  One critically injured passenger was found approximately 40 metres from the point of impact,” said Jamieson. He said that advanced life support paramedics worked on the man, putting him on a ventilator before rushing him to a nearby hospital where he passed away a short while later. “Two occupants were declared dead at the scene and the two remaining sustained serious injuries and were transported to hospital. The truck driver was not injured,” Jamieson said.
