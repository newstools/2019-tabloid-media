“Children need to catch a wake-up and stop being used by drug lords.” This was Samantha Thring’s heartfelt plea after her son, Chadley Thring, 19, was shot dead in an alleged drug and gang related turf war shooting on Barns Road in Sydenham, on Thursday. Speaking to The Springfield Weekly Gazette, a composed Samantha said, “Children need to catch a wake-up. Working for drug lords is not a life for young children. You will never be safe from harm and you will not live in peace.” Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said, “A case of murder was opened at Sydenham police station for investigation. On 1 August 2019 at 4pm, police received a complaint of a murder at Barns Road in Sydenham and proceeded to the said place. On arrival, they found a body of a 19-year-old man with three gunshot wounds on the head. The motive is unknown.”   Samantha said Thring was a child who did what he wanted. “I taught him the difference between right and wrong. But he had his own mind and chose to live his life a certain way. I found out on Saturday from his fiancé that they were to be married on Wednesday and were going on a honeymoon thereafter. That’s what Chadley was like. A boy of few words and suddenly he would do something and surprise you out of the blue,” said Samantha. It is alleged that Thring was targeted by the shooters who sought him out and opened fire on him whilst he was in the company of his friends.  Sydenham community activist and head of the Combined Community Watch (CCW), Domenic King, sympathised with the family and said, “This is indeed a tragedy. Another young life lost in such a senseless manner. Speculation is rife surrounding the fatal shooting but we lean on police to shed clarity and bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to book.” “I worry about the children in the community. They need to see how destructive drugs are. It is destroying our children. I have made peace with my son’s death. I know he is in a better place,” said Samantha.
