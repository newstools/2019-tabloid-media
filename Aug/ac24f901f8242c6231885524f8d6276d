The streets of shame in Ladysmith continues to be the ire of residents. The corner of Hillview and Fairclough is still overflowing with waste and rubbish. The Ladysmith Herald recently reported that residents’ complaints to the municipality fell on deaf ears. “It is a sight for sore eyes. It seems that the local municipalities don’t want to assist. There is no hope,” said an angry resident.
