A man accused of running a brothel has been granted bail. He was arrested along with ten women  following a raid on a suspected brothel in Durban North’s  Stirling Crescent. The raid was a joint operation between members of the Durban North SAPS, Crime Intelligence and the Organised Crime Unit. Durban North SAPS spokesman, Captain Raymond Deokaran said,“The women were arrested on suspicion of being prostitutes. “They included three illegal immigrants. The man is alleged to have used the home as a brothel. During the raid, police  seized 25 cell phones,  pornographic DVDs and other paraphernalia.” Haden Searles, chairman of the Durban North/uMhlanga CPF, said this was a warning that such activities in the area would not be tolerated. “This raid is as a direct result of the CPF, the community and the police working together. This property has been raided before on the suspicion of operating as a brothel and this sends a clear message that illicit activities will not be tolerated in the area,”he said. “In most cases brothels have a knock-on effect bringing drugs into the area and at times may even involve human trafficking. As the CPF we thank and congratulate the SAPS for their hard work in this case. “We’ve also identified several other properties allegedly operating as brothels and we’ve alerted the police to their presence,” added Searles. Residents are urged to report homes suspected of operating as brothels to the SAPS or the CPF.
