Not so long ago Child of Africa, a non-profit organisation based in Umbilo, Congela announced that it will be opening a school for under- privileged learners, operating under the Departments of Education and Social Development for Umbilo and surrounding areas. “We are people of hope, believing in a better life for all, particularly for vulnerable children,” said the founder and school principal, Richard La Colombe. He said since the school opened for registration, they have received a good response from the community and registration for créche, Grades R, 1 and 2 will be closing soon. “Registration will be closing on Friday, 30 August  at 5pm. “We are calling on parents who still wish to enroll their children to do so, before the closing date. Some parents took forms and have not returned them, we are urging to submit them due to limited places in our classes,” said La Colombe.
