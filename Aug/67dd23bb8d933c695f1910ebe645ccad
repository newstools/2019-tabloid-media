A retired principal who spent more than 40-year’s in the teaching  profession, has published his first novel, Chasing The Wind. Elwyn Bonhomme, 73, officially launched the book at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium recently. According to Bonhomme, the central figure in the story is  Thembikile Faku, whose search for a better life drags him through the world of poverty, discrimination, racial abuse, adultery, deceit, hatred and violence. Faku lived in Happy Valley, a shanty town in Wentworth, in the 1960s. Bonhomme, a bookworm, said famous authors like John Gordon Davis, Ken Follett and James Michener had inspired him to also be an author.  He remarked that the novel reflected his childhood memories, in a large family in Overport. One of his siblings is the late Trevor Bonhomme, a fiery activist during the apartheid era. “The idea to write the novel happened during a long bed rest I took after falling ill. When I began to feel better, I got down to putting my thoughts for the novel together.  I thank every one who rendered their support and encouraged me to go for it. My wife of 52- years, France was a pillar of strength. I dedicate the novel to France, our three children and six grand children,” he said. Bonhomme taught at Greenwood Park Primary, Briardene Primary, Collingwood Primary and, Fairytale Secondary. He was  deputy principal at  Gardenia Primary and principal at Charles Hugo Primary.
