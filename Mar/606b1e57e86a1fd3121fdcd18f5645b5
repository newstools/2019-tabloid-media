Phoenix residents are urged to attend the Sector 5 crime meeting which will take place at Promise Life Ministries, Swift Palm (behind Riverview Primary School) on Wednesday, 20 March, at 6:30pm.  The chairman of Palmview Crime Watch and former executive member of the Phoenix CPF, Vivian Pillay said, “Sector 5 is a sub-committee of the Phoenix Community Police Forum. The sector includes the Brookdale, Trenance Manor, Shastri Park and Palmview areas.Previously, sub committees from the different areas met every month to discuss the various issues concerning crime, safety and security with the ward councillor and the sector manager of the Phoenix SAPS. But as of late, the sector has collapsed, no regular meetings are currently taking place.” According to Pillay the community of Phoenix has a constitutional right to protection and service delivery. “I have been given the responsibility of hosting the meeting by Colonel Moodley from Phoenix SAPS, to build a vibrant and strong sector policing forum.The forum will meet every month to address community concerns, grievances and projects for the sector. The forum aims to be a platform to exchange dialogue and interactions with the role players and to mitigate against social ills. All concerned residents are urged to attend this important meeting. This is the only way we can take back our streets from criminals.” For more information contact Vivian Pillay on 084 605 6163.
