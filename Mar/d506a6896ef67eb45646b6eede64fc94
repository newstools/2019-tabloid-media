A Northcroft resident was robbed and almost raped when a lone suspect wielding a knife entered her house through the rear door 
which was opened and fled with jewellery and cash after tying her up, last Wednesday. Phoenix police are probing cases of house robbery and attempted rape said Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo. “The victim was traumatised. She was alone when an unknown man entered through 
the back door which was wide open. The suspect produced a knife and ransacked the house. The suspect forcefully took the complainant upstairs and ransacked all the bedrooms. He attempted to rape the victim. The victim could not scream as her mouth was covered and her hands were bound. Jewellery and cash was taken. The victim was transported by KZN VIP ambulance to Umhlanga hospital,” said Cpt Naidoo. KZN VIP spokesman, Gareth Naidoo, said the suspect had infiltrated the gated complex in the Northcroft area and unleashed his terror. “The resident was at home when she was accosted by an unknown suspect who wore a black shirt. He had scars on his face similar to tribal markings. The victim was found by neighbours in a severely traumatised state. She was treated by KZN VIP Medical on scene and rushed to a medical facility for further care,” said Naidoo. Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said, “We urge women, especially those at home during the day, to be extra vigilant. Ensure gates, doors and windows are secured. Do not linger outside and double check that locks are secured. These criminals are roaming around looking to strike out at vulnerable targets. An 
open door and gate is an opportunity for themto take advantage of unsuspecting victims. “Please be on guard and take the necessary security measures to ensure your safety and that of your family.”
