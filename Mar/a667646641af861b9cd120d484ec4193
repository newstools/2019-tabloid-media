Police from Inanda Cluster Task Team arrested a hijacking suspect and recovered a firearm at K Section in KwaMashu, on Thursday evening. Police spokesperson, Col Thembeka Mbele, said, “It is alleged that the police officers spotted a vehicle driving recklessly on the road and instructed the occupants to stop. As they stopped, two suspects alighted and fled on foot into different directions. “When police approached the vehicle, there were three occupants including a female inside the vehicle. Initial investigations revealed that a female and a male were the hijacking victims and the third was a suspect (23) with a firearm in his possession. It is alleged that on 28 February 2019 at 6:30pm, a female (32) and her nephew were leaving their home at Hendon Road in Kenville when the suspects hijacked them at gunpoint of their vehicle and their valuables including bank cards. The suspects assaulted the victims, forcing them to reveal their bank pin codes. They then withdrew victim’s cash from the ATM.” “A case of carjacking and possession of an unlicensed firearm was opened at the Greenwood Park police station. The suspect will be charged and will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on 4 March 2019. Police investigations are continuing to apprehend the suspects who fled,” Col Mbele said.
