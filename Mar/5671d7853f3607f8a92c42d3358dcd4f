About 30 homeless people will soon benefit from a free, three-month skills training course on welding. This joint initiative by volunteers of the Homelessness Task Forum, will give first preference to people who have access to the I Care drop-in centre in Greyville.  Anne Slatter from I Care, said she had secured a sponsor to fund the training of 10 people with the balance being funded by the KwaZulu-Natal School of Welding who will in turn obtain funds from the National Training budget. The course will run from mid-March for a period of three months per module. Slatter said volunteers are required to be trained as course facilitators to assist in afternoon classes from 2pm to 4pm or to run a further evening class at the Denis Hurley Centre from 5pm to 7pm.  She appealed to sponsors to donate towards tables, chairs and light refreshments for the 30 trainees. Regarding homelessness in the city, eThekwini Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer said she contacted officials from the provincial Human Settlements Department to request suitable premises to house the homeless. Councillor Peer had called for the establishment of the task team to address homelessness in the city in 2018. Chairperson of the Homelessness Task Team, Raymond Perrier said the artisan training is a great step which will assist with skills empowerment and job opportunities. â€œThe Task Team is now starting to put those findings into action and this welding course will make a concrete difference in the lives of 30 homeless people.
