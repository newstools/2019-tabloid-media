Provincial police spokesman, Captain Thulani Zwane said the panga attacker was arrested and that police investigations are continuing. Prem Balram, the director of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) said his operations centre had dispatched officers to the scene, following calls from the public. “The deceased bled excessively from his injuries to his head and arms.
