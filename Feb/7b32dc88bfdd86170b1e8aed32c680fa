The 33-year-old mother accused of dumping her baby in a stormwater drain in Newlands East, more than two weeks ago, was granted bail of R5 000 in the Ntuzuma Magistrateâ€™s Court on Wednesday. The state did not oppose bail. The woman who cannot be named to protect the identity of the baby, has two other children and was instructed in court not to communicate with the minors unless the interaction is facilitated by a social worker. The court restrictions forbid her from entering the Newlands suburb and she is restricted from communicating with witnesses. The woman was transferred to Westville prison upon her discharge from hospital where she was arrested. The accused faces a charge of attempted murder after her newborn baby was rescued from a stormwater drain following an attention-grabbing four-hour rescue.
