Overport community members and municipal officials under the guidance of the former Ward 31 Councillor, Chris Pappas and ward committee member Nicky Goss undertook the sixth clean- up operation of the ongoing Overport Revival campaign last Thursday. The team targeted the loop starting at West Road, proceeding onto Harbottle, East and Hartley. A specific focus was put on dumping hot spots as well as areas that have been neglected. Durban Solid Waste (DSW) and Metro Police were also part of the clean-up. Loud hailing took place to educate residents on cleanliness issues while volunteers handed out leaflets and engaged with residents. Pappas, who is still active in the area until the by-election on 7 August, said that the role of a councillor is to bring people and municipal resources together to improve the community. “Many people are not aware of the role and powers of a councillor and thus have a skewed expectation. A councillor is the interface between the municipality and the community and in this case, we were targeting the ongoing challenges in Overport regarding dumping and cleanliness,”  said Pappas. He continued to say that law and order is paramount if we are to turn our city around. That starts with enforcing bylaws at a local level. Goss, ward committee member for cleanliness and solid waste said, “We are really working hard with some dedicated members of the community and city officials. We need everyone’s buy in. Unfortunately, there are groups trying to undermine our efforts. “Let us come together and build a community that we are proud of.” Pappas said that there will be a number of trees planted in the coming weeks and that engagements about replacing water infrastructure were at an advanced stage.
