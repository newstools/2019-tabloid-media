Five-time Grammy Award winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo  hosted the first annual Isicathamiya Awards, the Cothoza and Acapella Music Awards (COMAs), on Saturday, 22 June at The Durban Playhouse. Professor Joseph Shabalala, who founded the Internationally acclaimed legends  59 years ago, said he was very happy that these awards were finally taking place, since it has been his “long time dream” for isicathamiya music to be recognised not only as a national music treasure, but also as a great cultural export.The awards presented by Ukhozi FMs Dudu Khoza and Uzalo actor, Masoja Msiza did not only honour isicathamiya artists, but  also  filled the night with entertaining live performances from The Soil, The Legacy, Abathandwa Ithemba as well as the acts who were honoured.“The awards  honoured and acknowledged great contributions made by isicathamiya groups dating back from the era of Solomon Linda who created the globally known classic “Imbube”, and also acknowledge the current isicathamiya artists who are the torch bearers of this iconic music genre. The slogan for the first ever COMAs is “Azibuye emasizweni a uzulu” an idiom loosely translated as “Let’s go back to our roots,” said Albert Mazibuko, who has been with Mambazo since it began.
