A brazen gang of armed robbers ambushed a security vehicle resulting in a shootout which left a security officer injured as the suspects made off with an undisclosed amount of cash and the security officer’s firearm, at a KwaMashu livestock business premises, on Friday. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) Phoenix Operations Centre received multiple calls from the public reporting a shootout in the parking lot of a livestock business and responded to the scene. Head of RUSA, Prem Balram, said, “On arrival, reaction officers established that the driver of the cash vehicle was shot in the foot. He was treated on scene before being transported to hospital by ambulance. It is alleged that at least six suspects armed with handguns and rifles ambushed a security officer as he exited the livestock business. They robbed him of an undisclosed amount of cash and his firearm when his colleague opened fire from the vehicle. The suspects returned fire. A bullet penetrated the driver’s door and struck the security officer on his foot. The gunmen then fled the scene in a silver hatchback vehicle. One suspect is believed to be shot. Several 9mm and rifle cartridges were recovered at the scene.” Police were on scene and investigating further.
