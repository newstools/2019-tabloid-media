Armed with high calibre weapons, four brazen suspects pounced on a businessman man who was on his way to the bank at the Phoenix Plaza parking lot, earlier today, and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash after firing shots in the air. KZN VIP and several other security companies as well as police responded to the scene after receiving news of the armed robbery. Spokesman for KZN VIP, Glen Naidoo, said, “Four suspects armed with R5 rifles arrived in a silver vehicle. They accosted the complainant just as he alighted from his vehicle and was making his way to the bank with a large deposit of cash. As the suspects departed they fired shots in the air sending patrons scurrying for cover. There were no reports of any injuries. Several callers called KZN VIP for assistance and reported that shots were fired. Police, KZN VIP and other security companies stood down whilst investigations were undertaken by SAPS.” Police spokesperson, Lt/Col Thulani Zwane, said, “A case of robbery was opened at Phoenix police station for investigation. The complainant alleged that this morning at 09:00, he was at Phoenix to deposit an undisclosed amount of cash. While he was opening his vehicle he was accosted by four armed men who robbed him of the cash before fleeing the scene in their gateway vehicle.”
