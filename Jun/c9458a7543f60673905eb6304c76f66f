Bellair SAPS held a bullying programme at Seaview Primary School on Friday, 31 May. The talk was informative and empowering to all. Bayview SAPS communications officer, Sergeant M. Pillay said that bullying can be identified in different forms which is physical, verbal, emotional or even excluding someone from a group because of how they look. “This usually happens by individuals or groups who misuse their power over other people. Making rumours about a person also amounts to bullying. Being bullied means that you are constantly being told hurtful things such as being called fat, ugly, picking on the person’s skin colour, instilling into that person that the person is mad,” Sgt. Pillay said. Pillay said that children need to learn that just as shoving and pushing someone causes physical harm, so does words cause emotional harm. “It can lead a person to end their life. Children need to learn that it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks of you. You don’t need anybody’s validation of approval. Payback is not the answer. “To stop a person from bullying you instead tell a teacher, parent or the police. Bullying is a crime. Numbers to call if you are being bullied are 10111 or Childline on 0800 055 555,” Sgt. Pillay added.
