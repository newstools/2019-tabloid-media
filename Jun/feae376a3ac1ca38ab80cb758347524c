Swift response by a local community social network group and Blue Security led to the rescue of a woman who was found bloodied but alive in some bushes on a sugarcane field in Avoca Hills, north of Durban, this morning. Blue Security tactical ambassador in Durban North Brendan Porter said the firm was alerted to the emergency after someone reported it on a local security group. “We arrived on the scene and found a woman, who appeared to be in her late thirties lying in the bushes, incredibly cold, traumatised and her t-shirt covered in blood. She was immobile so our armed response officer and a woman from the local community carried her out of the bushes. It is unclear at this stage what injuries she may have sustained or how she ended up in the bush. The Blue Security team is currently awaiting paramedics to attend the scene to transport the woman to hospital,” Porter said.
