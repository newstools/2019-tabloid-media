Police have warned the public against misinformation on social media regarding the kidnapping of Durban businesswoman, Sandra Moonsamy. A manhunt was launched after Moonsamy, 44, from Westville, was allegedly kidnapped on 30 May while she was in her car on Stapleton Rd in Pinetown. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said that it has come to their attention that there are various incorrect media reports doing the rounds pertaining to the alleged kidnapping. Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo of the Hawks said: “This office wants to place it on record that untrue media reports and interference of private individuals who have a financial interest in the matter are hindering the investigation. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation is aware of the ransom email that was sent to the family and it is part of our investigation.” Mhlongo said that the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation is constitutionally mandated to investigate serious organised crimes of this nature. “We therefore appeal to the public to refrain from posting false information that is continuously hampering progress on the ongoing investigation,” he said. An appeal is made to anyone with info on the incident to contact Warrant Officer Stompie Sonnekus on 082 778 8932.
