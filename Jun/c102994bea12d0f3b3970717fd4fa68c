The gruesome discovery of a deceased foetus has once again shocked the community after the grisly find was uncovered by a passerby at the corner of Phoenix Highway and Industrial Park Drive, on Friday. According to Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo, a passerby saw a blanket lying next to road covered with blood. “On closer inspection, the passerby discovered that the blanket contained a foetus. The foetus appeared to be fully developed. “The umbilical cord and placenta was still attached. It is not clear if the foetus was alive prior to birth or after birth. Investigations are underway as Phoenix detectives investigate an inquest case,” said Cpt Naidoo.
“We urge young mothers or those who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy to please consider the consequences of their actions. It is inhumane to discard an innocent being in such a cruel manner. Please visit the many organisations or help centres for assistance in such cases. Seek advice and counsel from trusted religious leaders,” Cpt Naidoo added. Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said, “This kind of action is atrocious. It is unthinkable that a person especially, a mother can dispose of a baby in such a callous way. It appears to be a norm in the area as there have been many such cases reported. “We urge women in the community to refrain from this despicable practice. No matter the circumstances, there is help out there.”
