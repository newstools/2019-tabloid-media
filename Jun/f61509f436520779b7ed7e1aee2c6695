Phoenix police are investigating an armed robbery case after a man was robbed at gunpoint on Pandora Street, recently. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo, said, “A complainant alleged that he was walking on the road, going to work when a man asked him for the time. “He tried to see the time on his wristwatch but could not because it was dark. He then took out his cellphone to check the time. Two men then screamed from across the road, ‘Take his watch.’ “The suspect then whipped out a firearm and pointed it at the complainant. The other two suspects joined in and they also robbed the complainant. The complainant’s watch, cellphone, workbag, wallet, R200 cash, ID and personal store cards were taken. The suspect fled towards Centralpark.” Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said, “We urge community members to be vigilant at all times. In this day and age, we cannot afford to risk personal safety by interacting with strangers over trivial matters. Criminals are ruthless and community members need to safeguard themselves in every possible way. “Do not linger and loiter. If travelling on foot try to get to your destination as quickly as possible without being distracted as this is a tactic used by wily criminals.”
