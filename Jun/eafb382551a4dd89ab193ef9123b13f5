A deadly collision between a bus and a light motor vehicle claimed two lives and left several others injured on Umbilo and Hillier Roads, this morning. Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find total chaos. Operations Director at Rescue Care, Garrith Jamieson, said, â€œA bus and a vehicle had collided before the vehicles left the roadway coming to rest on the pavement. Immediately more ambulances and Advanced Life Support units were dispatched to assist. Both occupants in the light motor vehicle were severely entrapped in the wreckage and there was nothing more paramedics could do for them and they were declared deceased on the scene. Twenty occupants from the bus had sustained various injuries and were stabilised on the scene by Rescue Care paramedics before being transported to various Durban hospitals for the further care that they required. At this stage, the cause of the collision is unknown, however, SAPS will be investigating further.
