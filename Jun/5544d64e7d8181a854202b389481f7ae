A full term baby has been rushed to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital after she was found dumped in a bush on Schoolside Crescent in Caneside, Phoenix, a short while ago. KZN VIP Medical and Response teams rushed to the site after being contacted by a resident who reported hearing a baby crying and requested assistance in investigating further. Spokesman for KZN VIP, Gareth Naidoo, said, “The resident waited for the arrival of KZN VIP and together the shocking discovery was made. The new-born baby girl was found dumped near a tree and wrapped in a piece of cloth. The baby appeared to have suffered a distressed birth and was stabilised on scene and rushed to hospital for further medical care. The new-born was assessed by paramedics to have been born approximately an hour prior to her being found.” “An appeal is being made to any witnesses to please come forward and help police locate this baby’s mother. Such callous abandonment of babies is becoming the norm in Phoenix and needs to be curbed urgently. If anyone has any information that can assist police to find the mother of the baby, please contact Phoenix SAPS on 031-508-2300,” said Naidoo.
