Made famous by a brawling video which went viral on social media, Keegan Reddy (28) of the ‘Warrapen Keegan’ fame burnt to death in a house fire in Seatides, Tongaat, on Saturday night. Chairman of the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) in the area, Nazir Sadack, confirmed the information and said the CERT team was dispatched for a house fire on Kallies Lane where the property was ablaze. “Upon arrival on scene, a part of the home comprising of the bedrooms were engulfed in flames. Neighbours were trying valiantly to douse the flames. I was notified that at least one person was still trapped in the room. Several attempts were made to gain access to the room to rescue the individual but to no avail as the flames and smoke were too dense. Once the fire was extinguished, a sweep of the home was conducted by firefighters. We found a man inside a room. Sadly, an individual identified as 28-year-old Keegan Reddy succumbed to his injuries sustained in the fire and passed on. It was confirmed that the deceased was the Keegan from the ‘Warrapen Keegan’ video. The house was badly ravaged in the fire,” said Sadack. He said there were reports that there was some kind of dispute that occurred at the house prior to the fire but police would be investigating further. “On behalf of CERT and the Seatides community, we extend our sincere condolences to the family. Members of the Tongaat Fire Department, Umhlanga Fire Department, Sgt Clinton Odayar from SAPS Search and Rescue, Tongaat SAPS members and the CERT volunteers are commended for their swift response and assistance on scene,” Sadack added. Propelled from obscurity into fame, Reddy became popular when a video of a brawl between friends went viral in 2016. Reddy was seen assaulting a man when a third person intervened coining the now famous phrase, ‘Warrapen Keegan.’
