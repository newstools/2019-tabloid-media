Ward 25 Councillor Hassan Haniff and former Ward 31 Councillor Chris Pappas, now member of Provincial Legislature have consistently maintained their day one election focus on turning Overport around. The newest improvements to the area can be seen in the upgrades to the sidewalk on Crescent Street as well as the replacement of the bollards in the park.  Councillor Hassan said that although getting things done in eThekwini is very difficult and very slow, it was important for us to always keep trying. 
“We must put our communities first. This has taken one and a half years and it is not the end, but, we are making progress,” he said. Hassan said that he is working hard at getting an outdoor gym for Overport, but budget cut backs in the whole city were hampering his efforts.  Pappas said, “Our project of Overport revival is an ongoing project. With the help of the community, businesses and faith- based organisations, we are making progress. Although there is still a lot to be done we can definitley see a difference. The new improvements in Crescent Street will compliment the other new side walks in the area as well as the new LED lights that we have had installed to combat crime.”  Pappas mentioned that there will be a community clean-up in the area on Thursday, 20 June with various departments and encouraged residents to assist by reporting dumping and service delivery issues in the area to the relevant departments.
