Phoenix police have issued a warning to the community to refrain from standing alone at isolated spots waiting for lift clubs. This comes after there were reports of muggings in the area. On Thursday, a man was waiting for 
his lift club on Brakenwood and Woodview Drive when an unknown man walked past him and then returned wielding a knife. Communications officer at phoenix SAPS, Captain L. Naidoo, said, “The suspect demanded for the complainant’s bag which contained a laptop and charger as well as a cellphone all to the value of R16 000. The suspect then fled on foot. In a separate incident, a man was seated in a vehicle with three others when three unknown men approached them. According to Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, two of the suspects brandished knives and demanded that the complainant hand over his wallet. “The suspects then robbed all of the other occupants of their cellphones and jewellery and fled on foot taking with them items to the value of R62, 800,” Cpt Naidoo said. “Avoid parking in motor vehicles on the road side as it is unsafe. Rather park the vehicle in the driveway.
With regards to standing on the road in the early hours of the morning and early evening, winter is upon us, therefore it gets dark early and the mornings are just as dark. It is advisable to make arrangements with the lift clubs to fetch you closer to home or even from your gate. It is not advisable to be standing on the road side at early hours of the morning as it is not safe,” Cpt Naidoo added.
