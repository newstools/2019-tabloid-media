Newly elected PR councillors, Andrew Sizwe Mokoena and Phindile Joyce Khumalo, and traditional leader, Inkosi Bantu David Khumalo were sworn into office during a special council meeting at the Newcastle Council Chambers last week. Mokoena replaces Councillor Sthembiso Leeroy Stein who tendered his resignation and Khumalo replaces Dr Ntuthuko Godfrey Mahlaba who became Newcastleâ€™s mayor. Magistrate Gurlal presided where both councillors and the traditional leader swore under oath to serve the community without fear or favour. They promised to carry forward the mandate given to them by council which is in line with the vision of the Newcastle Municipality.
