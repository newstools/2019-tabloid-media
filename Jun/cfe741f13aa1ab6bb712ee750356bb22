“An unbearable stench intensified at the hospital. Eventually it led to the storeroom, where fluid dripping from the ceiling provided the tell-tale signs that something was amiss. The search eventually led to the decomposed body.” Newly appointed KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu was commenting on the gruesome discovery of a man’s decomposing body in the ceiling of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital (MGMH), recently. The deceased has been identified as Sandile Sibiya, a builder, alleged to have hailed from Amoati, who was admitted to the hospital with an injury to his leg and was discovered to be missing days thereafter leading to a missing person’s report being registered.Initially pointed out as a mental patient, Simelane-Zulu dismissed such claims and said Sibiya was admitted with a broken right femur. Sibiya was arranged to be transferred to Addington Hospital for an appointment with an orthopaedic doctor, but was nowhere to be found. His body was uncovered more than a week ago in the ceiling of the hospital after a terrible stench and dripping fluid was investigated, unveiling the grisly find. Concerns have since emerged as to how a builder with a broken leg wound up dead in the ceiling prompting a probe by the Department of Health (DOH) and a post mortem by police. Sibiya’s body was identified by his family last Sunday. “The department is conducting its own investigation. We will not hesitate to take the strongest possible action should anyone be found guilty of any form of wrongdoing,” Simelane-Zulu said.
