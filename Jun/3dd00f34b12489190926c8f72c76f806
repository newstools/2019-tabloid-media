Police are investigating the shooting of a woman who was also robbed whilst on her way to a job interview on Sulzer Place in the Phoenix Industrial Park on Wednesday. KZN VIP Medics and Response teams were quickly dispatched to the scene where the shot victim was found traumatised. KZN VIP spokesman, Gareth Naidoo, said, “Upon arrival, a 32-year-old female was found to have sustained a gunshot wound to the leg. She explained whilst en route to a job interview near Sulzer Place she was accosted by a suspect. After surrendering her valuables, the suspect then shot the victim and fled. “A member of the public saw the victim laying on the floor and attempted to take her to get medical assistance at which point KZN VIP Medics stood off and began stabilising the patient on scene before transporting her to hospital.” Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) members also arrived on the scene and RUSA boss, Prem Balram, said, “It is alleged that the victim refused to hand over her valuables initially. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa arrived at the scene and found the woman being treated by paramedics from a private ambulance service for a gunshot wound to her right thigh. It is alleged that the victim was on her way to a job interview when she was accosted by two men along a railway line. “The suspects asked the victim to hand over her valuables when she refused. One suspect then drew a firearm and shot her in the leg before he stole her cellphone from her handbag. The two men then fled the scene on foot. The injured female managed to flag down a passing motorist who loaded her into his vehicle and drove to a nearby business premises where they sought assistance. A search was conducted for the suspects, however, no arrests were made,” said Balram.
