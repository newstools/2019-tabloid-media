A manhunt continues unabated for kidnapped 44-year-old Durban businesswoman, Sandra Moonsamy, as police, private security and a well-known private investigator, follow every lead and scours the province for the safe return of the Westville mum. Allegedly kidnapped from her black Range Rover after being ‘forced off the road’ by three vehicles on Stapleton Road in Pinetown on Thursday evening, Moonsamy is the youngest daughter of Poonsamy and Lutchmee Naicker, who run the multi-million rand logistics company, Crossmoor Transport, with their two sons, Alvin and Inderan. The mother of two, works at the family business in the finance department. Speaking on the violent kidnapping, Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) boss, Prem Balram said, “The vehicle’s driver side glass had two bullet holes and the left passenger window was smashed in. “According to a witness, several males in a silver VW Golf, a white hatchback BWM and a bakkie forced the businesswoman off the road. They then fired shots at the driver’s window when she locked herself in. Other suspects damaged the left window with the butt of a firearm and forced her out. “She was then pushed into a vehicle and driven away. A passing security vehicle attempted to follow the suspects and was fired upon. The victim’s handbag and phone were left at the scene.” There has been no positive lead regarding Moonsamy’s well-being since her abduction. Nathanson said a reward is being offered for Moonsamy’s safe return and reported that no ransom has been demanded thus far. Her brother, Inderan said that the family was ‘holding up’ as the search continues. He said that he could not comment further on the incident.
