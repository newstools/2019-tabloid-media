Ward 35 out going councillor Heinz de Boer has urged residents to register for the  bi- elections expected to take place on 7 August. Boer said, “Ward 35 is currently without a councillor, due to my resignation to take up a position in the Provincial Legislature. Currently there is a ward vacancy, and the IEC will conduct a ward by-election so that a new councillor can be voted in.” Boer said that it is a localised election and only residents who live in the ward can vote. “Many residents stay in Ward 35, but are registered elsewhere. This is problematic, as they will not be allowed to vote  unless they are correctly registered,” explained Boer. To end this, Boer said the IEC will have a registration weekend on 22 and 23 June where all the ward voting stations are open for registration. “Please check your status by sending your identity number to 32810. If you are uncertain where you should be registered please whatsApp me  and I’ll clarify for you,” said Boer. Ward 35 areas are uMhlanga, Gateway, Prestondale, Somerset Park, La Lucia, Glenashley and parts of Virginia. “Please don’t lose this opportunity to vote in a new councillor. It’s critically important that you make your mark.” For more information, please contact Heinz de Boer on 083 355 2343.
