The Ntenga Foundation Charity Run / Walk, one of the top unique charity mass participation events in KwaZulu-Natal, took place on Monday, 17 June to commemorate Youth Day. The annual charity run started from Moses Mabhida Stadium at 8am, to uShaka Marine World’s Wet ‘n Wild. Funds raised through this event went towards buying school shoes for underprivileged children. “I am delighted that once again we were able to do this event. Through it, we are able to provide less fortunate children with school shoes. “Our appreciation goes to all participants, because without them there will be no event. Not forgetting uShaka Marine World, who has become an integral part of the event with its much valued sponsorship and also its involvement,” said Siyanda Calvin Ntenga, chairman of the foundation.
