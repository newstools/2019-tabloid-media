A well-known Durban insurance broker, Andre Gopaul, was found dead in his hotel room last week.  According to reports, Gopaul was booked in as a guest at the SunSquare Suncoast and Towers Hotel. His body was discovered by a female companion when he failed to show up for breakfast the next morning.   It is alleged that Gopaul and his companion were supposed to meet for breakfast on Monday morning but when he did not show and his phone going into voicemail, she went to the hotel room to check on him. It was then that he was found lying face down on the floor. The discovery prompted the companion to call for assistance. Paramedics attending the scene confirmed that Gopaul was dead.  A statement released by Neo Mboniswa, spokesperson for Tsogo Sun Hotels, confirmed that Gopaul was a guest at the hotel at the time of his death. The hotel group conveyed sympathies to his family and friends.  The cause of Gopaul’s death is yet to be confirmed. KwaZulu-Natal police provincial spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said that investigations were continuing. “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated and the postmortem will determine the cause of death,” Mbele said.
