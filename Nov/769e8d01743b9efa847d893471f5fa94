He said that the Durban Fire Department, assisted by the community and Rescue Care Paramedics, had to use a ladder to get to the patient before bringing him down to safety.“One passenger had sustained critical injuries and was found lying in the slow lane. Advanced life support paramedics placed the man on a manual ventilator on the scene.
