Distressing revelations of a human trafficking ring operating in the Phoenix area, where teens have been exploited and forcefully photographed in a semi-nude state and also used as sex slaves, have emerged, with Phoenix police arresting a 37-year-old suspect on a charge of human trafficking, recently. The charge was initially rape but changed to human trafficking upon the arrest of the suspect. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo said that investigations revealed that the ex-wife of the suspect used her 17-year-old daughter to lure her young friends over to their home, informing the parents of the victims that they were all going away on holiday together. “The victims were then forced to take semi-naked pictures and the pictures were posted on escort sites. “One victim, a 17-year-old was forced to have sexual intercourse with several men for monetary gain which the suspect took. This incident occurred in a chalet on the North Coast. “Another incident occurred in the Durban North area where the same victim was forced to have sexual intercourse with several other men for monetary gain and again the money was taken by the suspect,” added Cpt Naidoo. She said that the suspect was arrested by Lt/Col Rajak of the Stimulus Task Team and his members, after gathering information on the suspect. “The suspect will be charged and will appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court at a later stage,” Naidoo said.
“This is horrific and shocking to the core. It is devastating to know that such appalling incidents are occurring right in our midst and our youth are falling prey to these devious ploys. “I urge parents to constantly communicate with your children in a caring and loving manner so you can protect and prevent them from becoming a sad statistic,” said Phoenix Community Police Forum chairman, Umesh Singh. 
“We commend police on the great job in arresting the suspect and hopefully more arrests will follow,” Singh added.
