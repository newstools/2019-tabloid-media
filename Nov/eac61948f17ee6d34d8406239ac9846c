A Brookdale tenant took leasing matters to a dangerous level recently when he fired shots at his landlord and the landlord’s son, thankfully injuring no one. Phoenix SAPS communications officer Captain L Naidoo said, “It is alleged by the complainant that on Sunday, 3 November, at 7:30pm, he was at his place of residence in Coralbrook, when an argument broke out between him and his father about the tenants who reside on the property. Suddenly one of his father’s tenants pulled out his firearm and pointed it in the direction of the complainant and shot twice. Everyone ran away.” <br />

After a case was registered, the 39-year-old tenant was found and detained at SAPS Phoenix for attempted murder. He will appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court,” added Naidoo. Phoenix Community Police Forum  (CPF) chairman, Umesh Singh said, “This situation could have ended differently with injuries or even worse, death. We urge community members to display tolerance and respect towards each other despite differences. Violence is never the answer. We need to address matters in an amicable manner.”
