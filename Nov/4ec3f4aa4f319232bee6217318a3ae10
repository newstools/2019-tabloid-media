It’s that time of the year, when the spirit of Christmas is in the midst of all communities and everyone is jotting down their wish list for gifts they’ve wanted all year long. The Springfield Retail Centre is inviting shoppers to take part in their ‘All I Want for Christmas’ competition,  which will most certainly make it less stressful this year.   To take part in the competition all you have to do is spend R250 or more at any of the retail shops between now and Friday, 13 December and stand a chance to win one of amazing prizes or gifts on offer, ranging from R250 worth of vouchers up to R5000 cash.  For more information visit www.springfieldretailcentre.co.za.
