A 21-year-old suspect’s criminal exploits were cut short when he was arrested by members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) after he was found in the home of his former employer, on Dianthus Road in Brindhaven, Verulam on Friday. RUSA head, Prem Balram, said that at approximately 10:36am on Friday, the RUSA Operations Centre received a call from a woman on the property, requesting assistance after she noticed a man in her home. “Upon arrival, reaction officers penetrated the residence and apprehended the suspect hiding under a pile of clothes in one of the bedrooms.  It was established that the suspect was previously employed by the homeowner as a general worker. On Friday, he entered the property and removed an outside tap, which caused water to spray uncontrollably,” Balram said.  He said that a female who was in the house with a toddler, opened the security gate to investigate the noise, when the suspect entered the home undetected. “When the female returned, she noticed him in the house and locked him inside. She then contacted RUSA for assistance. The uMshlasini Everest Heights resident was placed under arrest, and handed over to police for further investigation,” he added.
