The Denis Hurley Centre has had great success with ‘Street Lit’, a project to help homeless people, by giving them the chance to sell second-hand books. The centre is hoping to soon get permission to sell on the beachfront over the festive season and therefore, are in need of a lot more books including fiction and non-fiction, adult and children’s books.    According to the centre, they have no doubt that there are plenty of people who would be willing to donate books, and feel that now is a good time to clear some space before Christmas. Giving books to Dennis Hurley can transform lives, the alternative is that books are just pulped for waste paper, which is tragic. The centre has 12 convenient drop off points around the city and If anyone has a large donation they can contact the centre and collection will be arranged. DHC is urging the community not to give books directly to booksellers as they will struggle to transport them. To donate, contact the Denis Hurley Centre via email to Stuart@denishurleycentre.org.
