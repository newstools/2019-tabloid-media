Prospective students who wish to study at a public university or a TVET college in 2020 have exactly three days left before the closing of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) application cycle, on 30 November. As part of the intensified application drive, NSFAS has rolled out a regional “town to town” outreach intervention program, to reach out to prospective beneficiaries and students who have not submitted their applications. NSFAS aims to utilise these programmes to leverage equal opportunities for access in, and success to, higher education and training, mainly telescoping disadvantaged communities, and provinces with a low number of applications received. Over the next few days, NSFAS officers will be deployed across all nine provinces with a focus on the Eastern Cape, Free State, North West, Northern Cape, and Western Cape, due to the low number of applications received in these provinces. To date, the scheme has received 365 922 applications nationwide, with KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, and Limpopo provinces, continuing to lead with the highest number of applications. NSFAS administrator, Dr Randall Carolissen, said that, “Slthough the number of applicants living with disability increased significantly over the prior year to over a 1000, it remains disappointingly low. “NSFAS has prioritised engagements with relevant government departments and agencies to improve applications in this regard.” Applicants who do not have access to computer facilities and smart phones, are urged to visit their nearest National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) offices, local libraries, the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS), Thusong Centres, and Department of Basic Education (DBE) District Teacher Development Centres national wide, to apply for funding.
