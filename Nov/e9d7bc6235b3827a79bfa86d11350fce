Running for more than 10 years, with an aim to distribute Christmas gift boxes to needy children, between the ages of 3 and twelve, the Round Table Natal North Coast area, will once again host their annual Christmas Shoe Box collection project. The boxes will contain items such as a colouring book, crayons, a toy, toothpaste, soap, chips, sweets,a juice box and a lunch box. Last year, the group managed to donate a total of 407 boxes to children from two different charities, namely Key of Hope and Helping Hearts Charity Foundation. “This year we will be supporting the same charities, and others if our numbers allow. We are aiming to get over the 500 mark and in an effort to do this, we have reached out to companies to get involved, we have also set up a Zapper donation QR code, as well as a the website for donations,” said Dean Oldacre from the Round Table. The public can support the initiative by making a small cash donation towards the project, by using the Zapper code, which will be used to purchase and prepare boxes on behalf of the donors. Individuals can also contact the group to arrange a drop off or collection point, if required. The deadline for donations is Sunday, 1 December, 12pm midday.
