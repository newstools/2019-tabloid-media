This week saw truck drivers from across South Africa being recognised at a gala dinner and prize giving event, held at the Fire and Ice Hotel, in uMhlanga. This was after the Shell Commercial Fuels annual Distributor Driver of the Year competition,  at the Umdloti Testing Grounds. The event showcased Shell’s commitment to road safety by empowering its branded distributor’s drivers with the knowledge, skills, and training to make them some of the best drivers in the country. Frans Maluleke, Shell’s  Commercial Fuels manager, said as an advocate of truck driver wellness and education, the company is committed to promoting road safety and training among drivers. ” We believe that consistent driver education and skills development goes a long way towards enhancing road safety. This is especially relevant in the run-up to the festive season. Ultimately we want to ensure that our  drivers are among the safest drivers on the road,” he added. Pieter Andre Jacobs was named as the 2019 Shell Commercial Fuels’ Distributor Driver of the Year. Louis Lotter took second place and Nicholas Dausi was placed third.    Jacobs said: ” Make safety a lifestyle and a way of life. Attitude is important. Encourage others to be patient. Accidents are costly and should be avoided even if you have to arrive late at your destination. Especially during this festive season, the public and truck drivers need to be patient.” Israel Mutanga from Clermont said: “With the festive season upon us, people are rushing. The golden rule for  truckers and motorists is to be patient and to exercise caution.”
