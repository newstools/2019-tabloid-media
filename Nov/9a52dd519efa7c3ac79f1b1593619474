The weekend ended on a tragic note when two people were killed and three others injured in a single vehicle crash on the N2 South before the M25 KwaMashu highway on Sunday evening.Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene at around 11:30pm to find a single vehicle had overturned on the national highway. Operations director at Rescue Care, Garrith Jamieson, said, “The vehicle had five occupants at the time of the crash. Some were ejected and sustained serious injuries. The driver, a male, and one passenger, who was still entrapped, had sustained fatal injuries and unfortunately there was nothing paramedics could do for them, and they were declared deceased on the scene. Three other occupants were stabilised on the scene before being transported by ambulance to nearby hospitals, for the further care that they required.”Jamieson said the events leading up to the crash are unknown and SAPS will be investigating further.
