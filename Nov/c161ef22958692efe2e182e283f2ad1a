Black Friday fever has gripped Durban with thousands of shoppers expecting bargains galore tomorrow, 29 November. Spotted at Osmanâ€™s Cash and Carry in Springfield, are Fuzekazi Ngcobo, Bridgette Williams, Mathepane Ngcobo and Louis Lazarus, who are skipping the crazy long lines with early shopping. The Black Friday concept entered the South African market barely a few years ago and has its roots in the United States of America. Black Friday is the name given to the shopping day, after Thanksgiving. It was originally called Black Friday because of the volume of shoppers who created traffic accidents and sometimes even violence. In the 1950s, people began calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving, to give themselves a four-day weekend.
