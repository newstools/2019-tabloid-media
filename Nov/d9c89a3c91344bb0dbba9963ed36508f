Ever since he started walking dogs, he has never gone to bed in an amply stomach. What began as a means to an end has turned into a passion for Greenwood Park resident Army Majola who has been walking dogs around Durban North since May this year. Speaking to The Durban North News, Ladysmith born Majola said he started walking dogs after trying several times to find a job but to no avail. Even since then, he has immensely fallen in love with the job which he has turned into a business. He said there is no other job that he wants to do other than walking his dogs. “I was not going to sit around and wait for an opportunity I never knew when and if it was going to come. I had to stand up and take charge of my life,” Majola said.
Currently, he is walking seven dogs around Durban North, and has a good relationship with them. He has been living in Greenwood Park for 24 years. Majola is part of the Wellness Centre Trust, an NGO where he met Franck Kiala and other special people who have helped him with his dog walking job. The Wellness Centre Trust was established in 2014, when founder and director Eloise Briggeman became aware of the dire circumstances of the unemployed, homeless people in the communities of Durban and surrounding areas. The centre gives homeless and destitute people a second chance in life. Through the centre, Majola was able to establish his growing business. Majola said he is looking to expand his business so that one day he can give other people opportunities. “I am looking to get a warehouse where I can train others to clean, wash and take care of the dogs,” he said. So far Majola walks dogs six times a week depending on his agreement with the clients. He has flyers and T-shits stored at vet and pet shops around the area. He is soon planning to open his own Facebook account to reach out to more people in the community. For more information, contact Majola on 072 702 6398 or Franck Kiala on 071 377 4212.
