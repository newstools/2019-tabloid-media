A shocking discovery of about 500 syringes scattered on the grounds of Stanmore Park last week, sparked immediate concern for the safety of children and residents as well as creating a health hazard prompting a local councillor to act swiftly to address the pressing issue. Speaking to The Phoenix Tabloid, Councillor Lyndal Singh, said upon the discovery of the syringes, her immediate thought was for the safety of the community, especially the youth who frequent the park. “I was horrified to find that the mass of syringes were disposed of in such a haphazard and unsafe manner. My concern was for the community’s safety. I quickly called the  Parks and Garden department and fast tracked the clean up with the powers that be,” Cllr Singh said. She said that with a number of community members, including the little ones that make use of the park frequently, this had to be acted on swiftly to avoid any health hazard. “I sent out notices to the community via social media, including Facebook and WhatsApp to inform them that the park was cordoned off and temporarily closed. I commend the specialised unit and District 2 Parks official, Bonga Mthembu, for being efficient in ensuring that the park was quickly re-opened. It’s been confirmed by Mr Mthembu that the park is declared safe for public use and may be re-opened for public use,” Cllr Singh said. She said that there’s a fear that drug users could be using the park as a playground to indulge in their drug use. “We will not take this matter lightly and further investigations are being undertaken to determine who is responsible for the hazardous dumping and to ensure that those guilty offenders are dealt with according to the law,” added Cllr Singh.
