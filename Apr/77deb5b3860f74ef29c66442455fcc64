The search continues for missing St Augustine’s Hospital nurse, Sushi Govender who went missing two weeks ago. Since then community patrollers and private security companies have been rallying in a concerted effort to find the nurse. Govender, (50), a mother of two, did not return home after she was said to have gone to the Reunion Beach, near Isipingo, on her day off from work on 20 March. She worked at the private hospital’s Intensive Care Unit. Her car and belongings were found in the car park at the beach. Provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “The search for the woman is continuing. Police’s search and rescue unit had been to the beach each day to search for her.” Her distraught family said that they were looking for closure, said her brother Megan Palthas, while her husband Rogers fears that she might have drowned. He said that the family was in constant contact with the police. The family is appealing for anyone with any information on her whereabouts should come forward or call Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
