The body of a woman was found in her vehicle which was pulled out from a river in Umtentweni last week. Wendy Conde left Shelly Beach for her home in Umtentweni but the trip ended on a tragic note. It is unclear whether her vehicle was overcome by the raging current, following the floods on the South Coast and other parts of KwaZulu Natal. The deceasedâ€™s family became concerned for her safety after she did not arrive home.
