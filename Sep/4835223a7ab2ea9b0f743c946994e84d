“Crime in Glenwood is escalating, especially now that it is getting towards the end of the year”, this was an overall comment made by residents of Umbilo, Glenwood and Bulwer at their recent community meeting with the Umbilo Community Policing Forum, SAPS, armed response security companies and Metro Police, Umbilo Executive CPF chair,  Heather Rorick, said that this is a great concern for the community. Rorick said in the past week, she personally had to attend to twocrime related incidents in the community. Rorick said a woman and child were attacked on Bulwer Road, on Sunday, 15 September. “The woman and child were attacked and stabbed in the arm by a suspect who robbed her of her cellphone in broad daylight.  Fortunately, when the incident happened, members of the community including a doctor attended to the scene to find that the woman was stabbed in the artery and needed to be rushed to hospital,” said Rorick. She said, both the lady and her eight-year-old daughter were traumatised. ” A case was opened with the Umbilo SAPS and investigations will continue,” said Rorick. In another incident, Rorick was alerted on a hijacking that took place just outside of the Umbilo Police station, also on Sunday night. Rorick said a couple driving a maroon Polo was hijacked by suspects who drove a silver grey Polo with no number plates. “The suspects armed with firearms assaulted a couple, on the back of their heads and managed to flee away with a set of keys and the couple’s cellphones. Fortunately, there was no shooting and members of the community who witnessed the incident came out to assist the couple. The residents treated the wounds as an ambulance was not at the scene,” said Rorick. She said a case of hijacking was opened with the Umbilo SAPS. Rorick thanked the residents who reacted promptly in both incidents.
