A bullying case in Phoenix in 2017 landed a now 21-year-old suspect with a 12 month jail sentence under correctional supervision, after she violently assaulted a 16-year-old fellow schoolgirl, outside a local high school requiring her to undergo urgent surgery at the time. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo, said, “The former learner was convicted and sentenced by the Verulam Magistrate’s Court for assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. The victim was assaulted after school and as a result of the assault, sustained a fractured collar bone and had to undergo surgery.” The investigating officer, Detective Mgaga was praised for her sterling work in securing a conviction for the assault on a minor by the Branch Commander, Lt Col Lombard as the accused was much older than the victim. “Fights after school have become a norm, however, the victims are too afraid to report these matters fearing that they will become targets by other scholars. Reporting such cases will result in the accused being brought to book. We hope that this conviction will be a deterrent to the scholars who feel that they can bully their victims and get away with it,” added Cpt Naidoo. Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said, “The victim is commended for acting within the ambits of the law and reporting the case. Bullying in schools is of great concern and we as a community need to work with police to address this matter. “We applaud the police member for the meticulous detective work and the courts for a good judgement handed down. Bullies need to realise that their actions have serious consequences.”
