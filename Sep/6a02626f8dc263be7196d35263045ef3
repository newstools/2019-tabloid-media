Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) commander-in-chief, Julius Malema, was once again represented by his lawyers in the Newcastle Magistrate’s Court where he is facing  charges under the 1956 Riotous Assemblies Act and the Trespass Act. He is accused of allegedly inciting at an EFF rally in Newcastle in 2016, that people should occupy any vacant land they could find. The case received another postponement on Monday, 9 September. The court was devoid of any Malema supporters both on the inside and outside, owing to his absence. Malema’s lawyers did however make representation to have his case moved to the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court where the EFF leader is facing similar charges. His lawyers said they would prefer to centralise both cases so that there would be no need to travel to two separate places. The case has received several postponements since 2016 due to the fact that the EFF submitted an application to the Pretoria High Court to try and have the Riotous Assemblies Act declared unconstitutional.   However, the party  leader was deatl a major blow after the High Court struck down the bid. Malema has since taken his fight to the Constitutional Court. This means that his case in Newcastle is expected to receive several more postponements pending the outcome of the Constitutional Court’s decision. Should the court rule in Malema’s favour, both the cases in Newcastle and Bloemfontein will be dropped. The case has been postponed to 1 November
