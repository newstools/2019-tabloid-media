An 8.85 percent increase in Durban Transport fare was approved by the Executive Committee at a meeting on 13 September. A report, outlining the reasons for the increase, stated the increase would be effective from 1 August, noting that Durban Transport provides access to around 50 000 passengers daily and is funded through passenger fare income, a subsidy from the national budget received via the province as well as a contribution from council funding. According to the municipality’s acting head of communication, Mandla Nsele, the report  further stated that given the fact that operational costs escalate every year, the Durban Transport contract makes provision for an annual fare increase to enable the service level to be maintained. “An independent economic assessment is done annually to inform the recommended fare increase based on economic indicators. Following the independent economic assessment being undertaken, it was recommended that a fare increase of 8.85 percent be made. The report noted that in 2018 a fare increase of eight percent was implemented during August,” Nsele added. Nsele further said the report noted that in eThekwini there are 11 subsidised bus service contracts, operated by various companies, contracted by the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport. The bus fare of these bus service contracts has been 10 percent in the current year as well as in the last year, the report stated. “It was noted by the Executive Committee that the affordability of residents was taken into consideration during the fare increase which was kept under a double digit increase,” Nsele concluded.
