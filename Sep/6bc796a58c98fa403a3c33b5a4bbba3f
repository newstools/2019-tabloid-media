Nomusa Dube-Ncube reiterated provincial government’s focus on fast-tracking the entry of women into the digital economy. Critically, she revealed plans aimed at getting a girl to spend a day in the offices of companies involved in the information, communication and technology sector. “We acknowledge the fact that some jobs will become obsolete with the advent of 4IR. With investment in digital infrastructure and training, we have no doubt that we will minimize risks and maximize benefits.” She said that the plan was to train thousands of young people especially girls on artificial intelligence, digital content production, 3d printing, cloud computing, drone piloting, and software development. “We want to work with the private sector to make technology literacy a priority.
