Two elderly Fanpalm sisters were hospitalised after they were attacked by a swarm of bees at their Phoenix residence, on Friday. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) responded to the residence after neighbours heard the sisters screaming and called for assistance. “Upon arrival, Reaction Officers found both women standing on the roadside still being attacked by the swarm. Neighbours were in the process of hosing both females in an attempt to prevent them from being stung further.“Paramedics from the Provincial Ambulance Service treated the sisters for multiple bee stings to their faces and bodies before transporting them to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital,” said RUSA head, Prem Balram. “It is alleged that the hive was situated behind a wendy house where the two lived. It could not be confirmed as to why the swarm had attacked them,” Balram added.
