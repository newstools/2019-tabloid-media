The season of spring in South Africa is one of the two seasons, with a day dedicated to welcoming the season. The other is summer. Spring is celebrated by humans and also by nature, as flowers blossom and trees bloom with colour. Various organisations and communities have festivals and events to celebrate the dawn of the new season. 1 September, known as Spring Day, also falls in Arbor Week or Month, a period dedicated to planting trees in observation of nature. Nationally, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries promotes the celebration of South African trees to create awareness about their importance. This year’s theme is, ‘Forest and Sustainable Cities’, aimed at encouraging citizens to protect indigenous forests, prevent veld fires and plant a tree to green our country. Glenwood Preparatory School Junior Primary Department recently celebrated the first day of spring! Pupils from Grade 1 to 3 were asked to make a ‘spring hat’ to celebrate the occasion. All the educators and learners of Glenwood Prep thoroughly enjoyed themselves and really went out of their way to enjoy the creative celebration!
