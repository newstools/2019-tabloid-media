Ward 17 Councillor Sbusiso Khwela, has called on the community of Shallcross to be at the forefront of reporting service delivery issues to the municipality, so he can intervene. This follows numerous complaints made by the residents of Dunstan Drive, about the potholes that have made the street hard to navigate. Khwela said if the matter is not reported to the municipality, he cannot intervene and follow up with the relevant department. He said: “Without a complaint lodged with the municipality, there is no job card created for the depot to come to the relevant street.” The matter was brought up by the residents on social media, as well as educators from nearby Simla Primary School. This after one of their teachers experienced a blow out of one of their tyres, due to driving over a pothole. Khwela said following a previous article in The Chatsworth Tabloid regarding the matter, he checked with a person called Arlo, if there was a job card for Dunstan Drive. “Following our last conversation, I checked with the depot (Arlo) if there was a job card, and there wasn’t one. I’ve yet to receive a reference number from any of the residents indicating that they have actually called the call centre to lodge a complaint, which is a must. Only then, armed with reference numbers can I chase up the city about the issue of potholes along that road.” To report potholes, you can call the toll-free number at 080 1313 013, SMS 43554, send e-mail at eservices@durban.gov.za, or fax them at 031 311 8220.
