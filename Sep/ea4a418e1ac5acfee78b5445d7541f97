The much-loved radio deejay and comedian extraodinaire, Darren Maule, will be reprising his role once again as the host for the annual Tafta Fundraising Gala Dinner. As the push is on to raise funds for the Association for the Aged (Tafta) outreach programme. The organisation, Tafta, which looks after the elderly citizens of society, will be hosting their Gala Dinner on 25 October, at The Southern Sun Elangeni Hotel. Maule, who will be reprising his role, has been tasked with keeping the attendees entertained in yet and another night of opulence and fine dining. Tafta’s income development and public relations manager, Gail Samuels said this year’s event would serve the needs of elders within Durban communities. Samuels said: “Through the Purple Hearts: Honour the Elderly theme this year, our fundraising efforts have specific focus on raising funds for Tafta’s Home Based Care, a win-win community outreach programme where younger members of the community, trained in the Tafta Care Practitioner programme, are given the opportunity to earn an income, in return for tending to the needs of elders requiring daily support in under resourced communities. Tafta’s Home Based Care programme has extended significantly into the eThekwini Municipality. Today we reach out to 190 elders, ensuring their basic right to dignity is met. “But we realise the need to help more elders through this model of care is growing at a rapid pace.” Samuels said through the event, Tafta hoped to both sustain and increase the reach of the programme to more Durban communities. Tickets for the event cost R650 per person or R6 500 per table. This includes a three-course dinner, an exclusive gift bag and an evening filled with entertainment.
