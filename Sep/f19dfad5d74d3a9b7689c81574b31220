The members of Hands for the Nation provided hot meals and desserts to 150 underprivileged children in the Bhambhayi area recently. The Phoenix-based non-profit organisation provides lunch meals, wheelchairs, walking aids, adult diapers, baby hampers, grocery hampers and other necessities for the destitute. The organisation is appealing to businesses and individuals to donate all unwanted items such as household goods, office equipment, wheelchairs, walking aids, clothing, and toiletries. These items will be donated to children and their families that need help. “Hands for the Nation also appeals to young mothers that are destitute and abandoning their newborn babies to contact our organisation so we can help them locate homes for their babies. All information will be strictly confidential. “These mothers can contact our Save a Baby hotline on 076 559 5185,” said Collin Naicker from the organisation. To donate or sponsor towards Hands for the Nation, contact 064 511 9958.
