The Provincial Commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula, has welcomed the multiple terms of life imprisonment handed down to a serial rapist who terrorised women in the Westville area. “Investigators from the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences  Unit must be congratulated for their sterling work that saw this monster being placed before court. Our society is so much safer now that he is behind bars,” he said. Moses Mavila, 30, will spend his entire life in prison, after he was convicted and eventually sentenced by the Pinetown Regional Court on Friday, 30 August. He was sentenced to a total of 35 terms of life imprisonment and a further 425 years imprisonment on 61 counts which included rape, robbery and attempted murder. Provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said the accused pleaded guilty to all the charges and was sentenced to 35 terms of life imprisonment for each of the 35 counts of rape. “A total of 27 years imprisonment for each of the 15 counts of robbery and a further 10 years imprisonment each for two counts of attempted murder.” The accused began his crime spree in 2013, terrorising women who were seeking jobs along the M19 in Westville. It is alleged that he would lure his victims by promising them jobs and would lead them to a bush along the M19, where he would rape, rob and strangle them. The victims cellphones and cash were stolen during the attacks. The last incident was reported in January this year. Naicker said, all of the cases were eventually handed over to the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit to expertly investigate. “An experienced and dedicated investigating officer was tasked to trace the accused and he was eventually arrested at his place of employment in New Germany in February. The arrest of the accused brought to an end reports of rape along the M19,” he concluded.
