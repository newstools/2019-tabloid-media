ProBono.Org is an non-profit organisation (NGO) that works with private attorneys to facilitate the access of quality wills drafting services, pro bono, to those members of the public that are otherwise unable to afford the services of having a will drafted (especially the elderly and pensioners) throughout the year. A will or testament is a legal document by which a person, the testator, expresses their wishes as to how their property is to be distributed at death, and names one or more persons, the executor, to manage the estate until its final distribution. The purpose of a will is to ensure an orderly winding up of the financial affairs of the deceased, and the protection of the financial interests of the heirs. The main function of the Master of the High Court’s office is to supervise the administration of deceased estates. In this regard, ProBono.Org will be working closely with the Office of the Master of the High Court, as well as probono private attorneys, to provide members of the public who attend the Wills Week Help Desk with the required legal services to draft or update their will. This will ensure that their wishes are followed after their death. ProBono.Org will be hosting Will drafting sessions to commemorate National Wills Week in South Africa and invites all members of the public to their Wills Help Desk from Monday to Friday, 16 to 20 September. The help desk will run from 9am to 12pm daily, at the office of the Master of the High Court, 2 Devonshire Place, Durban. This is an opportunity to allow you to plan for when you pass away and provide for your family, friends and loved ones in the way that you choose, as well as ensuring that your assets are protected by having a valid will in place.
