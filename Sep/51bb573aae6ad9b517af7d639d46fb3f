While gender-based violence is the real truth staring communities in the face, the Mayville and Sydenham SAPS Community Police Forums are hosting an awareness march against gender-based violence. The march is in partnership with eThekwini Outreach and eThekwini Secure, both community-based organisations. It takes place on Friday, 20 September, starting at 7pm. The community will gather at Overport Secondary School, where the walk starts, proceeding towards Moses Kotane (Sparks) Road and culminating at the corner of Moses Kotane (Sparks) and Randles roads. Participants will converge in the park on Randles Road, opposite the Shifa Hospital, holding a candle lit vigil followed by short talks on gender-based violence and its effects.
“Gender-based violence, and femicide, is among least spoken about crimes in South Africa. It is about time that this comes to a full stop. Awareness campaigns such as these need to bear the fruits of change,” said organiser, Nasrin Kadwa of the Mayville SAPS CPF. “For too long have women and children been at the receiving end of abusive men. More time and effort needs to be given by lawmakers to ensure that such abusers do not get off with a mere slap on the wrist. There are horrifying things happening out there, many of which we do not know of. No more talk, the time for action is now,” said Kadwa. Kadwa said that it was about time that men too take the lead in joining these campaigns. She said that men were responsible to ensure that they take a stand and root out the evil ones within communities perpetrating these atrocious crimes. Added chairperson of the Mayville SAPS CPF, Imtiaz Syed: “The community is encouraged to participate in this very important event. Do not become a victim. Learn how to deal with abuse. As CPFs we are here to help empower communities. Police forums are not merely talk shops, but a platform where social ills are discussed and solutions are explored.”
