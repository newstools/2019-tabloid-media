sells clothing and linen, cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor. During the bail application, it was found that in June 2019  he lured the 12-year-old and three other girls to his home in Chatsworth under the pretext of needing help to clean his house. He took the girls to his bedroom one at a time, where he abused them. He then gave each of them R50 and sent them home. Only the 12-year-old told her family what had happened. The matter was then reported to the police.The unmarried man denied the rape allegation.

He called each of the girls to his bedroom, performed oral sex on them, gave them chocolates and money and told them to leave,” said Ellappen. “He pleaded guilty to sexual assault in June 2014 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, suspended for five years. Then, in December 2016, he was arrested on two counts of sexual assault. He once again took girls, aged 13 and 14, to clean his home. Once again he took them into his bedroom, fondled them and made them perform oral sex on him. He gave them R30 each and left them along the Durban Beachfront. “He pleaded guilty to sexual assault in September 2017 and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, suspended for five years.
