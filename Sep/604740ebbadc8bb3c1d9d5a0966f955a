The Phoenix Widows Support Group, Caneside branch, recently welcomed the spring season with a glitzy spring ball at the Caneside Liberary Hall. In keeping with the season, the women were dressed in brightly coloured outfits and playful masks to complete their vibrant looks. The members engaged in lots of fun-filled activities and games and were entertained with music and dance. The ladies enjoyed every moment of the day which culminated with a delicious lunch over conversations as they reflected on the needs of widows in society.
