Isipingo SAPS strongly supports the campaign of no violence against women and children in South Africa and are planning a series of programmes to be unveiled to address the grave issue within the Isipingo policing precinct. Speaking to The Southern Star, Isipingo SAPS communications officer, Captain David Ragavan, said, “The issue of brutal crimes against women and children is a global concern with South Africa being spotlighted and we have serious incidents reported locally as well. “It is our aim to create awareness in the community and caution locals to safeguard their children and protect the women from brutality.” According to Ragavan, two minors were reportedly raped recently in the Malukazi area, in separate incidents. “A Malukazi grandmother was informed by a social worker who escorted her minor granddaughter home that the child had been raped on several occasions. It is alleged that the child was raped by a male who claimed to be the child’s boyfriend. It is alleged that the child went to the tuck-shop and was accosted by the male who pulled her into a nearby toilet and raped her. A case of rape is being investigated,” said Ragavan. In the second case, a minor girl from Malukazi, was raped after she was snatched while playing outside. “The woman found blood on the child’s underwear and discovered that she had been raped,” Ragavan said. The eThekwini Outer South Cluster FCS Unit are investigating the cases of rape. “We are trying to establish CPF structures in the Malukazi area and efforts are being made to highlight the concerns of violence within the community. “We want to empower the community and encourage them to ensure that the children are supervised at all times. Parents and caregivers must know the whereabouts of minors at any given time,” said Ragavan.
