Be on your guard at all times and do not give human traffickers an opportunity to add you to the statistics of this serious crime. That was the message from Captain Carmen Rhynes, of  uMlazi SAPS Communications, to girls at Shumayela Secondary School at a ‘Girl’s Take Charge’ talk. She told the pupils that trafficking of people, is a serious crime and a grave violation of human rights.”Every year, many men, women and children fall into the hands of traffickers, in their own country and abroad. Almost every country in the world is affected by trafficking. Some countries are used as   transit destinations of the victims. The crime  involves a huge professional network of criminals operating across borders and nations,” said Rhynes. According to Rhynes, many trafficking victims hail from  poor communities. ” It is important to bring awareness and education on the subject of human trafficking. Our youngsters must know that it can happen to anyone. Umlazi SAPS feels that it is important that the community is educated about human trafficking, so that they do not fall for anything that sounds too good to be true such as employment overseas, soccer scholarships and modelling work. Pupils must refrain from chatting to strangers on social media and must educate themselves on social media safety rules. Our girls must not chat to strangers via Facebook or hand their ID documents over to strangers,” said Rhynes.
