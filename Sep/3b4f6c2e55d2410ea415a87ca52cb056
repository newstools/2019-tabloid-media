A serious collision between two trucks on Goodwood Road in Westmead, Pinetown on Friday evening, left a truck driver entrapped in the wreckage. Netcare 911 responded to reports of a collision and upon arrival on scene, medics assessed the scene and found that the driver of the rear truck had sustained moderate injuries.
Media liaison officer at Netcare 911, Shawn Herbst, said, “A Netcare 911 rescue technician had to use the Jaws of Life to free him from the wreckage.
The patient was treated on scene and once stabilised was transported by another private ambulance service to hospital for further treatment. All necessary authorities were on scene.”
