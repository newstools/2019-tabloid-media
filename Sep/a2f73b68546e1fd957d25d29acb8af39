The Denis Hurley Centre invites the public to sharpen up their computer skills at their free computer room facility. “The computer room is not a structured course were one can get a certificate, however, it is a space where individuals can get more practice with learning how to use a computer,” according to centre director, Raymond Perrier. He said that volunteer coaches will be on standby if individuals need any assistance, they will also give aid to those who need help with searching the internet, refining a Curriculum Vitae, completing an assignment or learning how to write more clearly. “Individuals can also complete their own work by bringing it on a flash drive, internet and printing will be available within reasonable limits,” Perrier said.  The centre is calling for volunteers who are interested in joining the computer room. Hours for the facility are from 1pm to 4pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
