More than 1178kg of plastic and other waste was removed from the Umbogintwini river mouth on International Coastal Clean-up Day. More than 200 volunteers joined members of  Clean Surf Project, Sapphire Coast Tourism and others in removing nappies, sucker sticks, glass, plastic bottles, needles, candles, dead chickens and other rubbish. Romy Wenzel of Clean Surf Project and Sapphire Coast Tourism thanked Sasol, Plastics SA, CGCSA (Consumer Goods Council of South Africa), the Polystyrene Association, Coca Cola, DEFF (Department of Environment, Forestry and Fishery), eThekwini Municipality, Durban Solid Waste, various schools, Metro Police, Amanzimtoti Country Club, MMKH Recycling, ATKV Natalia, Amanzimtoti Scouts and Amanzimtoti Lions for supporting the clean-up campaign. Said Wenzel: ” The sad reality though is the fight against marine plastic pollution must continue to stop marine species from ingesting or getting entangled by plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and deaths. Plastic pollution threatens food safety, the well-being of people too, coastal tourism and contributes to climate change.” She added that the Clean Surf Project team is gearing for National Marine Week which will be observed from 7 to 11 October. “Its purpose is to create awareness on the marine and coastal environment and to promote sustainable use and conservation of these resources, for the benefit of present and 
future generations,” said Wenzel.
