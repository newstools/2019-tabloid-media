In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a group of students embarked on a protest outside the campus on Steve Biko Street in Durban where a maintenance room and two security guard houses were set alight with a 27-year-old security guard who works at the tertiary institution, also sustaining critical injuries following an attack by the protesters. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said, “They assaulted him, poured petrol on him and attempted to set him alight. He was rescued by his colleagues who witnessed the attack. He sustained severe injuries and was conveyed to hospital for medical attention.” “Police were alerted of the attack and due to their swift response, managed to apprehend nine students aged between 20 and 30-years-old. They will be charged for attempted murder, malicious damage to property and public violence. They will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon. The situation is under control and police officers from Berea SAPS as well as the Public Order Police Unit are at the scene to monitor the situation,” said Brig Naicker. The Provincial Commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula has condemned the violence displayed by students. “As the South African Police Services, we will not hesitate to arrest those who are found to have contravened the law. We reiterate that no grievance can ever justify students breaking the law and endangering the lives of other citizens. We call on students to raise their grievances within the confines of the law,” he said. Join Our Newsletter [newsletter]
