As the countdown continues to the first paper of the final matriculation examination for the Class of 2019  throughout the country, revision is well underway in all secondary and high schools. In KwaZulu-Natal a total of 42 453 full-time pupils sat for the mid-year exams coupled with 26 219 part-time students, bringing the figure to 68 672. While nationally, the combined figure was a staggering 350 000 registered candidates to write the annual examination, as compared to the numbers that were lower than 200 000 in the past, for both exams. Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu, said it was all systems go for the province and they were aiming for a 80 percent pass mark. Also aiming will be high schools around the Chatsworth area, as they look to improve on the previous results. Among the schools looking to surpass their past year results will be Chatsworth Secondary. The school, based in Bayview, last year improved on its dismal 2016 pass rate of 27.3 percent to 77.7 percent, under the leadership of principal, Arthur Luckhan, and the rest of the educators. Mshengu said that success needed to be emulated for the province to reach their target of 80 percent. The first day of the National Senior Certificate Examination is 16 October where a number of learners will be undertaking the Computer Applications Tech P1, three-hour practical. Then kick-off begins on 23 October, with English Paper One to be taken by all full-time pupils. The exam timetable is also available on the Department of Education website for download and printing.
