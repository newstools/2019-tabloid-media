Three people were killed in what appeared to be an ambush after unknown gunmen opened fire on a taxi last week. According to police, at about 7.25pm on Tuesday evening, 3 September, a 47-year-old taxi driver and five passengers were travelling from Colenso to Ezakheni when the shooting happened. KwaZulu-Natal SAPS provincial spokesperson, Thembeka Mbele said: “Whilst at A Section at the corner of Isinkwe and Rholihlahla Road, an unknown man travelling in his vehicle fired shots fatally wounding the driver and two passengers aged 23 and 55.” Residents told The Ladysmith Herald that they heard repeated loud, exploding noises resulting in them taking cover in their homes. “Only when we heard people screaming for help, did we notice that a shooting had taken place,” said one of the residents. They watched in horror as the families of the deceased gathered at the scene after the shooting. Some family members collapsed in shock. Mbele said that two passengers sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to hospital for medical attention. “At this stage, the motive of the killings is unknown. No arrests have been made,” she said. The names of the deceased have not been released.
