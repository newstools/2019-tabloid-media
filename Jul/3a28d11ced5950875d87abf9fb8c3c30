Malvern police are cautioning residents to be vigilant after a pensioner lost R12 000 in an email scam recently. Corporate communications officer Warrant Officer Radhika Marimuthu said an elderly woman in the Malvern area received an email informing her that she was a beneficiary in a will for a substantial amount of money. “The lady sent a return email and was asked to deposit a sum of R12 000 into the account in order for the process to be facilitated. The benefactor was allegedly from America. Once the funds had been deposited, the lady tried to contact the person through email but received no response after several emails having been sent,” said Marimuthu. She said that a case of fraud is being investigated. Marimuthu said members of the community are urged to display caution when scanning items for purchase on websites and when answering adverts. “Caution should immediately be raised when money transfers, deposits and bank particulars are requested. Also, never part with your money unless the correct item advertised has been exchanged.”
