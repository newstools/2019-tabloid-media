Hirsch’s uMhlanga recently hosted their monthly business networking morning, where likeminded individuals gather to expand their brand and business as well as network together. The guest speaker for the day was Cindy Norcott, owner of Pro Appointments recruitment agency and the founder of the Robin Hood Foundation. Norcott spoke on ideas for mentoring and motivating entrepreneurs with tips on how to light a spark in  their businesses. The packed audience listened attentively on the key tips to improve and market their brand. Norcott, the winner of the Margaret Hirsch Woman In Business Achiever of the Year Award 2016, has written an extremely successful motivational book for business people entitled ‘How To Be Unstoppable’. The book talks about how to be different and be on top of your game. Norcott concluded, “Be humble, be hungry enough and focus on what you do best.” For information on the forthcoming business networking event, contact Denver Naicker on 031 570 4000/ email: Denver@hirschs.co.za.
