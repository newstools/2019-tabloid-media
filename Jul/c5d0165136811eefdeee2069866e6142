Durban socialites and fashionistas were star-struck when the Vodacom Durban July Invited Designer Showcase was revealed at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping on Saturday night. The nine designers involved took totally different approaches to their interpretations of the “Stars of Africa” race day theme, providing fashion-lovers with creative ideas for their garments. From traditional tribal shapes and pattern prints to dramatic modern Afrofuturistic looks, the crowd that packed around the runway at the Wavehouse was treated to a rollicking visual bonanza. The outfits will be presented onstage at The Lakes Lifestyle Village Action Stage shortly after 2pm on the day of the big event at Hollywoodbets Greyville. The main event will take place at Greyville Racecourse on Saturday, 6 July.
