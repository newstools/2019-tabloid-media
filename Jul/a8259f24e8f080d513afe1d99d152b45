Pupils, teachers and staff of the Islamic Educational Centre armed themselves with gloves, overalls and face masks as they battled to clear waste along Covent Hill in the Ladysmith CBD area. This was the IEC’s 67 minutes of service and to commerate Mandela Day. “We are here to clean up and make people of Ladysmith feel proud of their town,” said the team as they filled bags off rubbish to clear a pathway. “If our town is clean, then we as residents feel better as well.”
