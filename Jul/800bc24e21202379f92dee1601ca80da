Comrades finisher and Stella Athletics Club runner Jardi Clark participated in the  Mauritius 42km Marathon on Sunday, 14 July. Clark says she was quite nervous about taking part in the race as her legs were still tired from running the Comrades a few weeks ago. She said to her surprise, she did not only complete the race but won the race in her first attempt. “My coach Prodigal Khumalo helped me train for this race and believed that I could be ready in time,” said Clark. Clark’s family was born in Mauritius and her older brother lives there and she says it has always been in her bucket list to run this race. ” This is my first real big win in a race.  It was such a great feeling. I ran 3hours and 17 minutes, which is not my personal best but it was 10 minutes faster than my marathon time from earlier this year. I’m happy about the results and I can say the race was definitely one of the most beautiful races that I have ever done,” added Clark. She said she will definitely love to compete in the same race again next year.
