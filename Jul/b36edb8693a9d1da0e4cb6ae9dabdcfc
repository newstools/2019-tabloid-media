Glenwood High School is supporting KwaZulu-Natal theatre couple, Aaron McIlroy and Lisa Bobbert McIlroy who are currently are putting the pieces of their lives back together after their home in Beckenham Place burnt down over the weekend. The couple was away at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown at the time. After the incident, social media was buzzing with messages from fans, friends, family and neighbourhood residents who want to support the couple during this devastating time. Glenwood High School posted on their friends behalf urging members of the community to donate for the couple as they had lost everything. Clothes and non-perishable items are been collected and the drop off point is 32 Kelvin Place, Durban North or Pam Golding in Montpelier Road. The McIlroys said they are overwhelmed by the love and support shown by people when they arrived in Durban earlier on Monday  to see the damage and what was left of their home.  It is alleged that at the time of the fire, their daughter, and her friend as well as a family friend were in the house but were not injured in the fire. Lisa McIlroy posted on  her Facebook page responding to the messages of condolences. “Please forgive us if we have not responded to all the messages individually as we have literally not had the time.The fact that no one was hurt in the fire is the real blessing. We are so thankful for your prayers at this time, please continue to hold us up in your prayers and thoughts at this very stressful time as we start rebuilding our home. Thank you all so much,” she said. Family friend, Sonia Corris, said they have been praying for the couple and anyone who wants to donate can contact her on
