Two thieves enjoyed a free train ride when they jumped aboard an empty commuter train from a depot in Umkomaas and travelled about 12km. They disembarked at Umgababa and left two security guards stunned. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) is trying to make sense of the theft. It is  unknown how the duo managed to get into the train and  drive it,  It was reported that after the train stopped in Umgababa, the suspects jumped off and fled into the nearby bushes. According to Prasa spokesperson, Zama Nomnganga, an internal investigation was underway.  Nomnganga said the incident was ‘highly sensitive.’ “That was a high-risk activity, as anything could have happened to the driver and the the suspects. It was irresponsible of them. This is not a PlayStation. They could have had a head-on collision. They and innocent commuters  could have killed people. The train could have been derailed,” added Nomnganga.
