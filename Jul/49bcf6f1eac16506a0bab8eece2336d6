The Clean Surf Project (CSF) team and Sapphire Coast Tourism has expressed their gratitude to the Grade 7 pupils from Laerskool Roodekrans who assisted with the recent clean-up at ATKV Natalia Resort. In total,  201kg of rubbish was collected in just one hour. Romy Wenzel of CSF and Sapphire Coast Tourism gave the boys, girls and teachers from Roodepoort in Gauteng,  and the tour guides from Outdoor Environmental Education Africa Tours, a big thumbs up. The clean-up was followed by a presentation highlighting the negative impact on marine life caused by plastic pollution. “It was a pleasure meeting the enthusiastic pupils,” Wenzel. “They were fantastic. We have a splendid relationship with Outdoor Environmental Education Africa and look forward to hosting more schools in the coming weeks and months. The team is planning to have a clean-up on Mandela Day, 18 July. “We will be spending 67 minutes at Toti Lagoon to celebrate Nelson Mandela’s birthday. By acting on that idea, people in our land can make a big difference. Schools in the Sapphire Coast region are welcome to join us,” said Wenzel.
