In Celebration of Womens Month Nu Metro at Pavillion, Westville is inviting the community to a morning of sweet indulgence and fun entertainment in celebration of women on Saturday, 3 August from 8.30am to 11.30am. The hilarious comedy chick flick, ‘The Hustle’ featuring comedic heavyweights Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson, will be screened at the event and guests can expect a laugh a minute film that is best shared with your girlfriends. This event is in aid of the Sunflower Fund, enabling them to create awareness and education about blood stem cell donation, recruit more blood stem cell donors, grow the patient support fund and maintain a registry of committed donors. This in turn means greater hope of cure for patients who are diagnosed with life-threatening blood diseases and who are in need of a life-saving blood stem cell transplant from a matching unrelated donor. Tickets are R230 per person and include tea or coffee on arrival,  a cake, an entertaining movie, a goodie bag, enviable raffles and loads of awesome prize giveaways. The Sunflower Fund is also appealing for sponsorships of goodie bags and prizes  to give-away on the day and anyone who wishes to sponsor or book for the event can contact Alison Ekstrand on  031 266 1148 or by emailing her on alison@sunflowerfund.org. Booking is essential and seats are limited.   For more information on The Sunflower Fund, please call toll free 0800 12 10 82 or visit www.sunflowerfund.org Pictured getting ready for The Sunflower Fund Women’s Day Charitea is Athabile Ketsiwe of Chateau Gateaux, Nockey Dlomo of The Sunflower Fund, Nu Metro’s Nonkululeko Khoza and The Sunflower Fund’s Steph Berry
