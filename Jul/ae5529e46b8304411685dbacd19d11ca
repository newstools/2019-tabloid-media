The Penny Appeal way of doing charity is simple – they take small change and make a big difference with it. In a first for the organisation, they have announced their first South African comedy tour, Penny For A Laugh, to highlight and raise funds for some of their local projects. Hosted by Riaad Moosa, the tour will feature an all-star line-up with Annalakshmi, Chris Forrest, Conrad Koch and Chester Missing, Farhan Esat, Mo Vawda, Ndumiso Lindi, Neil Green, Simmi Areff and Tumi Morake taking to the stage on the 12 July at the Durban ICC. “We’re very excited to be part of this tour because of all the good it can do, helping support orphans and health initiatives plus having a belly laugh in the process. What could be a more worthwhile exercise?” comments Riaad Moosa. The Penny Appeal is a relief and development organisation providing aid to communities in need, while advocating and addressing the needs of marginalised groups. Penny For A Laugh, progressed by Blu Blood, has been inspired with the intention of raising funds for Penny Appeal’s local projects and creating awareness about the various thematic areas of focus under which they work. Tickets from R200 will be available for purchase through Computicket. Proceeds will go towards various projects including Penny Appeal’s ‘Children of the World’ campaign.
