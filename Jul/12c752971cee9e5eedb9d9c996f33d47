Two brothers were hijacked of their vehicle last night, in Isipingo Hills, and endured a terror ride in the boot of a hijacking gang’s vehicle before they were dropped off in Lamontville unharmed. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the motorist had arrived at his brother’s house at around 9.50pm when the hijackers pounced on them. “The motorist’s brother went outside when he arrived at his home and while they were standing in the driveway the gang of hijackers suddenly pulled up in a vehicle.  Several suspects jumped out of the vehicle and produced firearms, holding up the motorist and his brother at gunpoint,” Mathios said. “The suspects then forced the motorist and his brother into the boot of the vehicle and fled the scene in their getaway vehicle and the motorist’s hijacked vehicle. The suspects drove to Lamontville where they dropped off the victims, unharmed. The two men then made their way to the Isipingo police station for assistance.” Mathios advised residents to be vigilant when receiving guests and to avoid spending time outside greeting guests or saying goodbye, especially at night. “Always ensure that there are no suspicious vehicles near your property when you open up your gates for guests and be sure to close the gates quickly once they have left,” he said. In a separate incident South of Durban in the early hours of this morning, a gang of armed robbers stabbed a security guard at a business premises in Clairwood. The incident occurred at around 2.26am. “The security guard was in the guard room when three suspects arrived and one of the men produced a knife and held him up. The suspect stabbed the officer in his back and the gang then grabbed a truck tyre and rim off the property and fled the scene. Paramedics were called to the scene to assist the injured security guard,” Mathios said. Members of Brighton Beach SAPS attended the scene of the crime.
