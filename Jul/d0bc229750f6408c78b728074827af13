As part of it’s ‘War on Waste’ programme, Ward 71 is partnering with DSW (Durban Solid Waste) to host 10 community clean ups and waste management education programmes between July to September 2019. Ward 71 ANC Councillor Previn Vedan said, “One of the major concerns that has been raised in our community has been litter, illegal dumping and improper disposal of waste items. Since its inception our ‘War on Waste’ Program has focused on waste management education, clean-up programmes, and enforcement against illegal dumping. The programme involved a door-to-door educational campaign and community clean ups.” Vedan further said, “We are launching a 10 week programme in which we want to partner with the community, be it street committees, CPFs, NGOs or individuals. We want to identify 10 strategic areas to hold the program in which the community can be involved.” The first clean up is planned for Friday, 12 July and at Kalas Street in Shallcross. All clean-ups will take place on Fridays and between 11am to 12am. All those that would like to take part in the programme can contact Councillor Previn Vedan’s offices on 031 311 2568.
