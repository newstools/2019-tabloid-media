Razed taxis and a truck remain as evidence of a fire that took place outside a family home on Newlands West Drive. The incident which occurred on 16 July, razed three taxis and the truck which parked at the family home over night. Neighbours say they were alerted to the fire when the blaze had engulfed one of the taxi’s, setting the rest alight. A neighbour who spoke to The Springfield Weekly Gazette under anonymity said, “We don’t know how the fire started, but when we looked out the window, the taxis were already on fire.” The neighbour said initially they thought it was the homeowner burning some rubbish in his yard. “We did wonder why the fire was so big if they were just burning rubbish. Thats when we looked out the window and saw that the taxis were on fire,” she said. The Fire Department was called to the scene and first responders, Crisis Medical, confirmed the incident. Crisis Medical spokesperson, Kyle van Reenan said, “On arrival, a family home and several vehicles were found well alight. Paramedics were on standby as eThekwini Fire and Rescue crews worked to battle the blaze. There were no reported injuries.”The cause of the fire remains unknown and will form subject of an investigation. However, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said, “Police were notified of the incident, however no case was opened.” Another neighbour said this is the second tragedy to have struck the family in less than a year. The neighbour, who also wanted to remain anonymous said, “The family suffered a huge loss last year. The owner of the taxis lost his wife last year, during the flood. And now this, its too much for one family to go through. Hopefully, they will recover from this and get through it.
