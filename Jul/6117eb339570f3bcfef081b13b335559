The Dis-chem Foundation recently brought joy to management, staff and volunteers of Khanya Hospice with a big donation of  various medical products. The hospice’s CEO, Neil McDonald (pictured), said his organisation cannot thank the  foundation enough for the wonderful gesture. ”Khanya Hospice does not receive a subsidy from the government. Instead, we rely on donations and the goodwill of businesses, community organisations, people, schools and others to assist cancer patients in various areas on the South Coast. “The cost of medication is expensive. The Dis-chem Foundation has over the years been a pillar of strength to my organisation. Without the donations from our partners like the foundation and others, we will not be able to do the humanitarian work in the suburbs and rural areas,” said McDonald.
