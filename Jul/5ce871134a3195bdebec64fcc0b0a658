The family of Sadek Ebrahim, who discovered the patient with maggots in his mouth at RK Khan Hospital, recently issued a letter of demand to the Department of Health to pay R7 million in damages. A video of the 52-year-old deceased went viral on social media causing outrage amongst residents and community leaders. Ebrahim was a patient at the hospital situated in Chatsworth from 19 June where he was being treated for gangrene. On 23 June, Ebrahim’s son Azaad made the discovery after he noticed his father’s upper lip was extremely swollen. This week, Durban attorney Theasan Pillay of Theasan Pillay and Associates confirmed they were acting on behalf of the Ebrahim family. The family alleged that Ebrahim was not regularly attended to or examined and was treated in an “inhumane and disrespectful manner”. They described his care as being substandard. The family claimed that they were still suffering emotional trauma, anxiety and distress from the incident. The claim is R2 million for Ebrahim’s wife and R5 million for his son. They have given the Department of Health 30 days to pay. The department has not replied to queries.
