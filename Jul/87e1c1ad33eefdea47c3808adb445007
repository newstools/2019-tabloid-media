It was an eye-opening Sunday morning for a motorist whose vehicle veered off the roadway, climbed an embankment, and came to rest on the boundary wall of a property along Northern Drive and the Phoenix Highway. KZN VIP Medical and Response teams were quick on scene and spokesman, Gareth Naidoo, said, “The driver of the silver VW Polo was lucky to escape with minor injuries after his vehicle ploughed up an embankment colliding with a wooden structure, before coming to rest on the boundary wall of the property.“The residents of the property were awakened after the loud bang and remained traumatised following the incident. The driver was taken away by SAPS.” In a separate accident, six people were left with moderate and minor injuries when two vehicles collided on the R102 and Northern Drive intersection, on Sunday. According to KZN VIP’s Naidoo, a vehicle is believed to have bypassed a traffic signal along the R102, near Phoenix. “KZN VIP Medics were on scene and managed to stabilise all patients before transporting them to hospitals for further medical attention. All emergency services were on scene,” said Naidoo.
