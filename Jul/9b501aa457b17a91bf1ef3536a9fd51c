Team work between police and security, led to the arrest of a man for allegedly being in possession of a stolen vehicle after a vigilant Blue Security armed response officer noticed the suspicious vehicle driving in the neighbourhood, last Monday morning.Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said that the armed response office spotted the suspicious Isuzu double cab as it was about to park outside a property in Brayford Avenue at around 8am.  “The officer immediately conducted a check on the vehicle which reflected as a wanted vehicle on the police database. He called for backup and several armed response officers responded to the scene and intercepted the vehicle,” Mathios said.“Police then swooped on the scene and took the driver and vehicle to the police station for questioning and further investigation. The police then arrested the driver and impounded the vehicle after he could not provide a satisfactory reason for the status of the vehicle,” Mathios said. He said that the driver had alleged that the vehicle registration had been taken from a Mazda 323 which was why it had reflected on the database as a stolen vehicle. Mathios commended the armed response officer for his vigilance and swift response at the scene.“We are committed to fighting crime proactively in the neighbourhood, working closely together with the community and the police, and this latest arrest shows that our strategy is continuing to produce positive results,” Mathios said. Meanwhile, on Thursday, a joint effort between Marshall Security, the SAPS and Tracker saw the successful recovery of a Mercedes Benz taken during a house robbery in the Phoenix area earlier. Marshall spokesman, Kyle Van Reenen confirmed that the vehicle was found abandoned in the Newlands area. “The suspects remain at large.”
