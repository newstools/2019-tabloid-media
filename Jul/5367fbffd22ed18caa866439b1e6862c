A 36-year-old man faces seven counts of fraud after he allegedly conned seven people out of more than R500 000. Sugen Naicker made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrateâ€™s Court and remains in police custody since his arrest in April. It is alleged that Naicker conned seven people known to him, promising to invest their money which would gain high returns. It is alleged that Naicker pretended to be a regional sales manager for Wesbank and promised a victim that he could purchase repossessed vehicles and sell them at a profit, which he would give to the victims. Two of the victims were allegedly in school with Naicker while another woman lived on his road. He faces seven counts of fraud with the total value estimated at R594 000. In his warning statement during his arrest, Naicker said he intended paying the victims back. State Prosecutor Kuveshnie Pillay opposed bail. A pre-trial was set for 31 July.
