About 100 pupils and individuals have been transported to hospital following an alleged ‘chemical emission’ at a school in Umlazi L section, earlier this morning. According to Rescue Care Operations Director, Garrith Jamieson, at least 60 casualties were still needing medical attention. “Rescue Care paramedics responded to numerous calls for medical assistance. On arrival they were met with chaos. It is alleged that some scholars were playing with a ball of some kind which then tore open and a powdery substance was spilt. This substance was then picked up by the wind and entered multiple classrooms affecting multiple learners and educators.  EMRS and Rescue Care Paramedics called for more resources to assist due to the number of injuries. The SAPS and Metro Police Search and Rescue unit were also called to assist. Four patients, an educator and three scholars had sustained critical injuries and were stabilised on the scene. The Lenmed1 Aeromedical Helicopter was called in to assist for rapid transportation to the Lenmed Ethekweni Hospital and Heart Centre,” said Jamieson. He added that the SAPS Bomb squad was called in and took over the scene with local detectives. At this stage the substance is unknown and will be investigated by police.
