“A support group is like a family away from your own. Cancer survivors and those affected by cancer come together in supporting each other in walking the cancer journey, the emotional remuneration from this experience can be compared to none,” said Sphe Mabaso of CANSA CANSA Durban is inviting cancer survivors, families and the community to be part of their local CANSA support groups in their various areas. Mabaso said walking the cancer journey with someone who has had first hand experience, provides a level of understanding that no professional can provide. “We are calling on to all those who have heard the words ‘you have cancer’ and have triumphed against this dreadful disease, as well as those who have had loved ones who heard these words, to volunteer to provide care and support to those who need it the most.” she added. If you would love to join one of their support groups, and help support those who need you the most, contact Sphe Mabaso on 031-205 9525 or send an email to smabaso@cansa.org.za “We would love to hear from you.” ended Mabaso.
