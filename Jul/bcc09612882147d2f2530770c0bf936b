Wheelchair bound, Andante Primary School Grade 4 pupil, Sbongakonke Mgabhi and his classmates, spent 67 minutes donating food, blankets and giving their time in helping out at the Ladysmith Animal Anti cruelty League shelter. “The class had spent most of the month collecting dog and cat food, to take to the shelter,” said Grade 4 teacher, Siobhan Chetty. Mgabhi was elated when the shelter’s Anna-Marie Koen brought over puppies for him to cuddle. He told The Ladysmith Herald that he would have loved to take one home. The learners and Mgabhi were excited and said that  everyone should make a difference in the lives of others, even little dogs and cats that do not have a home. “Everyday should be Mandela Day,” said Mgabhi. “If I can do it, so can you.”
