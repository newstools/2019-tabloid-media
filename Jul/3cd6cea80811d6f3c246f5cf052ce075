A 44-year-old Malawian national is in a critical condition after his hand was sawn off  last week, while building a dog kennel in Amanzimtoti. According to Midlands EMS spokesman, Derrick Banks, Midlands EMS paramedics were stopped by the local SAPS who directed the ambulance crew to the scene. “Once paramedics arrived on the scene, they found the patient seated at the back of the house with a towel wrapped around his right arm. The paramedics placed a tourniquet around the arm before they removed the towel to see the injury. “The hand was completely severed. Paramedics covered the wound and kept pressure to avoid any more blood loss. “The owner of the house had placed the hand into a container with ice before emergency personnel arrived on the scene. The patient, along with the hand, were rushed to a nearby hospital for further medical care,” Banks said. Banks added, “It is believed the patient was cutting wood with an electric saw to make a dog kennel when the incident occurred. It is unclear what went wrong. Police are investigating.”
