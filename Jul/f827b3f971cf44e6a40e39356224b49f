Residents of Umbilo have raised concerns about black garbage bags are piling up on the side of the road in Kenneth Gardens in Umbilo. The piles of garbage have not been collected and it seems this has been going on for a while now. Residents say this is not the only problematic area. Queen Mary Avenue is also looking like a litter field and no one seems to be doing anything about it. Some of the residents say the blame should not be put on eThekwini Municipality’s DSW department. ” It is not that the DSW workers are not doing their jobs, but rather an issue of people not being responsible for their own litter,” said the resident. She said people should know better than just to deliberately throw litter on the floor, expecting others to pick it up. Ward Councillor Mmabatho Tembe said with regard to the garbage bags on Kenneth Gardens, the bags are left to be collected by DSW, however she is not sure whether the collection is done late in the evening or it is not done at all. The councillor said she has been in contact with DSW regarding the black bags on Kenneth Avenue
