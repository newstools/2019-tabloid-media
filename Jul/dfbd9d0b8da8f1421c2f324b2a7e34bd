Some of his fish include Asagi, Showa, Benigoi and Khohaku. â€œLoumeau said that keeping Koi fish is not only reserved for the wealthy. He encourages those who are thinking about keeping Koi to come to the show, where the society will be offering advice on how to keep the fish, exploring the different filtration methods as well as how to deal with challenges they encounter.
