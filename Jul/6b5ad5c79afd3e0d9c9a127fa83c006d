Eden College’s Grade 11 learner, Sarushka Naidoo is inviting the community and fellow learners to the college’s ninth Eco Fresh Fest, on Sunday, 4 August.  Sarushka will be featured in the fest as one of the learners who recycles clothes into educational games for early childhood development schools that are underprivelaged. Jean van Elden of  Eden College said there will be a Green Sustainable Careers Expo Hall which is aimed at exposing high school students to careers that are sustainable. She said various organisations will be part of the fest. “Lumec, Earth Organisation, UKZN and Optimal Health are amongst the exhibitors which will be exhibiting in the hall. We will also have a number of interesting workshops on the go  which include; the Clothes to Good Project that Sarushka has been involved in. They will be providing students with the opportunity to make educational games and toys from waste for ECD schools.” Van Elden  said The Neptune Project from UKZN will also have a stand in conjunction with partners such as UMCEBO Designs where students can learn about turning waste into art as a viable career. “The Eco Fest is a free family fun-filled day that has a large fleamarket selling locally made and sustainable goods, a buzzing food hub and many events such as an inter-school ‘Eco Quiz’ and a fashion show. All are welcome to join in the festivities,” she added. Van Eden said this is an opportunity for the community to learn about how you can make changes to your everyday living and lower your carbon footprint, relax and be entertained at the Rhino Stage area or watch the field events throughout the day. “There is something for everyone. If there are any green businesses who would still like to exhibit ,they contact the charmain at edengreenfest@gmail.com ,” she said.
