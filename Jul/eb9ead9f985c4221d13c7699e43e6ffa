The 14th edition of the Dundee July surpassed all expectations as thousands of event goers were treated to spectacular entertainment, heart-stopping racing and inspiring fashion that put the event on par with the very best. The annual rural horse racing event which takes place in the small town of Dundee has risen to the challenge year after year in order to showcase the best in local talent. Strong winds and cold weather could not dampen spirits as spectators gathered at the racecourse to see competitors from KZN, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape and Lesotho vie for the title and cash prize of the day. The event featured a women’s only race too. The races are unique in that they remain traditional by horses trotting instead of galloping. The main race was won by Summer Time who was ridden by Tebogo Rasenya taking home R100 000 and a trophy. Off the race track there was plenty to keep spectators entertained, from a fashion village and A-list entertainment to sumptuous cuisine and an exhibition by local crafters, Dundee did not disappoint. The KwaZulu-Natal’s MEC for Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation, Hlengiwe Mavimbela, who was in attendance, said she was pleased with the success of the horse racing event and the standard by which it had grown.
