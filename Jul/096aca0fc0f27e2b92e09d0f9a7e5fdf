The Durban July to be run at Greyville Racecourse on Saturday, 6 July, is not only the biggest horserace on the African continent, but is also the social event of the year. Now for the first time after decades of being one of the biggest thoroughbred owners in the country, retired businessman, Roy Moodley has a runner in the July. Moodley and his wife, Mumsy, are over the moon that their horse, Roy Had Enough, will go head to head with the country’s best horses on Saturday. Roy Had Enough is carded number 13 and will jump from barrier 15, which Mrs Moodley drew at the barrier draw at Gateway last week. The horse won the Track and Ball Derby at Scottsville in fine style and is one of the rank outsiders in the big race. Moodley made history in 2017 when he led five of his horses into the winner’s enclosure. On that day, he had no other runners. Moodley has also won the KZN Owner of the Month prize on several occasions. He told Tabloid Media that he was ecstatic to have a runner in the big race.”It is the dream of every trainer, owner and breeder to have a July runner. I have been associated with the horseracing industry for decades and I am glad that my horse has finally made the cut in the July,” said Moodley.
