Made for More Foundation is inviting all Superhero’s, to get out of their dusty suits and join in a celebration of South African’s hero, Nelson Mandela on 13 July as they host the Mandela Day Surf Session at uShaka Beach. The foundation is asking “What are you doing for Mandela Day to give back to our beautiful city and nation?” Julia van Zyl, managing director said there are three ways that the community can support the event. “You can join in the fun by supporting and donating R67 or more to our cause, by giving 67 minutes or more of your time, or dressing up as a superhero,” she said. The wheelchair access mats will be set up at uShaka Beach as well as the adaptive water chairs. Volunteers are encouraged and welcome to serve, support and join in the fun. “All money raised will help get our Made For More Adaptive Surfers to the World Adaptive Surfing Championships in California, USA at the end of the year,” said Van Zyl. Numbers are limited for the  Adaptive Surfers, to join RSVP to julia@madeformore.org.za and secure your spot.
