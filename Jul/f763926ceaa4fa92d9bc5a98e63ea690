The community of Silverglen Drive in Chatsworth said their final goodbyes to a well known academic and lecturer at UKZN (former UDW),  Sagren Pillay, this past weekend. Pillay was stabbed along with his brother during a home invasion last week. An unknown number of suspects had allegedly gained entry into their Silverglen home and a scuffle ensued, leading to the fat stabbing of Pillay. The 56-year-old has been described by family friend ,Tony Govender as pillar of the community. An emotional Govender said: “We are angered by the death of our dear friend and would like the police to work extra hard in finding the people who did this.” The murder of Pillay had been the second murder in days to rock Chatsworth. Earlier in the week, Crossmoor businessman and father of three, Farhaad Mohamed, was killed in a shooting in Shallcross. The murder had angered the community, Govender said “If the police do not make this case their priority in finding the people who did this, we as a community are determined to take matters into our own hands.” While another resident, Melinda Naidoo said: “Criminals are ruling our streets and we are fed up of it.” So far no arrests have been made, the murder investigation is still ongoing.
