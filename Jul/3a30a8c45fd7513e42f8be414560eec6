Excitement is in the air ahead of the MTB Race and Trail Run at Port Edward Holiday Resort on Sunday, 7 July. The race, which forms the first round of the South Coast Fever MTB and Trail Run Series, has attracted a large number of entries. It will start and end at sea level. Most of the climbing will be in the first part of the race. The starting point will be at Port Edward Beach, where riders can grab some coffee and experience the sunrise before they register to race. Participants meander through macadamia and banana farms before they smell the fresh roasting coffee beans at the Beavers Creek farm estate. Thereafter, they will ride on the world famous Clearwater Trail with its spectacular single tracks and view deck overseeing the stunning Umtamvuna Gorge. From there, they will reach the Red Desert â€“ the smallest desert in the world. There are grasslands, forests and wetlands surrounding this natural wonder. After the Red Desert the home stretch will be insight. There are two river crossings where riders will have to get off and get their feet wet to cross at least once. There are also some road crossings, so riders are urged to listen to the police officers and marshals at all times. To enter and for more information, visit www.bundubashers.org.
