Drug arrests are ongoing in the Phoenix area and members of the Phoenix Crime Prevention unit are striving to keep the streets clean by making drug arrests on a daily basis. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, said, “An assortment of drugs have been confiscated and the accused have been arrested in the past week. Constable JD Moses effected an arrest last Saturday at about 7:50pm at a tavern on Stanmore Drive. The accused, Shaheen Gopal, was arrested with seven mandrax tablets and 19 pieces of cocaine. The accused was detained and appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court on Monday.” Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, commended police on the arrests and urged them to continue the good work. “We need members of the public to keep their eyes and ears open and anonymously report drug trading in the Phoenix area. We need to save the lives of our youth and rebuild the fabric of society in Phoenix by weeding out the scourge of drugs,” Singh added.
