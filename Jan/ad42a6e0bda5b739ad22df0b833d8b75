The start of the new school year is not only an exciting time for learners, but is also an ideal time for road safety educators to highlight to learners, parents, and drivers the risks of becoming a road crash victim. Road Safety deputy director, Marlini Pillay, said children are at significant risk on the roads. “The Back To School campaigns provide an integrated platform to interact with school children, parents and the taxi industry in promoting safe road usage. “The campaigns play an important role in shaping the attitudes and behaviour of road users thus ensuring that they become responsible drivers, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists,” said Pillay. Learners were addressed on adopting safe walking habits, which included looking twice before crossing the road, the correct use of pavements, see and be seen, as well as the dangers of using cellphones or earphones while walking. “Parents were reminded that with the return of the school run comes the additional stress of rush hour traffic. Road safety hints, road rage, keeping to the speed limit and the importance of using safety belts were discussed with parents.” Activations were also extended to taxi ranks, urging public transport drivers to transport children safely and to adopt safe driving habits at all times. “Taxi rank managers, owners, associations, and drivers were urged to become compliant with legislation and to pay special attention to increased pedestrian activities in the vicinity of schools,” she said.
