Local snake catcher, Fanie Cilliers recently made his “biggest catch” to date in the Ladysmith area. “I removed one of the biggest Mozambique spitting cobras that I have ever caught in my snake catching career. The cobra had a length of 1.75 meters. It killed chickens and devoured 12 chicken eggs as well,” said Cilliers. He said that according to records that he checked, the cobras’ length is usually one to 1.2 metres, and rarely grows beyond 1.5 metres. “So this one was a monster,” he said. Mozambique spitting cobras or a Naja Mossambica will eat anything from road kill to eggs. With this heat, the Ladysmith snake removal specialist has had many calls to remove these spitting cobras from several homes in the area. “Residents are leaving their doors open. This is creating a problem as human interaction with snakes increases and thus the risk of a bite increases as well. Most people switch the lights of in their homes and then when the snakes enter, they are not seen or are seen too late,” said Cilliers. “The snakes are entering homes for two reasons: The first is after a possible meal, like a rodent or frog that crept into the house or it is trying to cool down.” Cilliers recently suffered a “dry-bite” from a spitting cobra. Shocked, he was worried that there was no anti-venom solution in the Ladysmith area. “However, I was blessed as this was a dry bite, the first-ever from a Mozambique spitting cobra as they do not spare any venom when they bite. The provincial hospital was excellent and they managed to draw five ampules of anti-venom from the Estcourt Hospital and another five from from Emause hospital in Bergville. Luckily, I did not need a drop of it,” Cilliers told The Ladysmith Herald.
