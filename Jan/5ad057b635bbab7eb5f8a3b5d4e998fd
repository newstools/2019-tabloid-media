Just two days before Christmas, three congregants were held-up by gun-wielding suspects and robbed at their church premises in Lotusville last Saturday. The suspects masqueraded as men interested in renting a property prior to the robbery unfolding. Reaction Unit South Africa 
(RUSA) head, Prem Balram, said at approximately 4:26pm, members of RUSA were called out to the scene by the victim reporting the robbery. “Upon arrival, it was established whilst setting up the church for a prayer, one of the worshippers were approached by three men in a champagne-coloured Toyota Fortuner on Lotus Road. The men made enquiries regarding a property for rent in the area before they drew firearms and forced him into an office. “Two other church-goers heard the victim screaming for assistance and they went to his rescue. They were also held up by the armed men and locked in the office. One of the victims was robbed of his Hisense cellphone. The suspects also stole a sound system before they fled the scene in an unknown direction,” Balram added. He said reaction officers conducted an extensive search for the suspects, however, no arrests were made. “It is indeed a sad day when criminals strike and rob a place of worship. “Thankfully, the victims were unharmed. Suspects are devious and have no regard for anything sacred but to employ their crime tactics for criminal gain,” said Balram.
