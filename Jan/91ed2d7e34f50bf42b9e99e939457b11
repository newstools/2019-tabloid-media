A Phoenix doctor was stabbed in his thigh and his patients and staff as well as a medical rep were robbed of their belongings when three men stormed the Allingstone Place surgery on Thursday. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, said, “The receptionist alleges that she was at her workplace when a patient proceeded out of the room and three unknown men pushed their way into the surgery with a gift bag in hand.  One suspect pulled out a firearm from the bag and demanded cellphones and cash from the patients, medical rep and two receptionists. Two suspects proceeded into the doctor’s consulting rooms and pointed a firearm at the doctor. With a gun to his head, the suspects demanded for the doctor to point out the safe. The doctor replied that he had no safe and one of the suspects stabbed him on his thigh. His cellphone and cash was taken. “The suspects fled on foot and with their loot of seven cellphones and an unconfirmed amount of cash,” said Cpt Naidoo. “This is yet another atrocious display of crime where opportunistic criminals target the vulnerable. It is concerning that the doctor was stabbed but thankfully, he will make a full recovery. Crime is rampant and we need to be on guard constantly. Sadly, we cannot anticipate at every turn when these perpetrators will strike,” said Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh.
