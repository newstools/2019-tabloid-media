A multi-departmental team took to the streets in Musgrave around the Berea park to do a thorough clean-up and enforcement drive on Monday, 21 January. The operation targeted basic maintenance issues, education about dumping, maintenance of trees and a clamp down on taxis and traffic violations. Ward 31 councillor, Chris Pappas said that the operation was attended by the Parks Department, Electricity Department, Metro Police, DSW and DSW Education as well as architects from the Urban Design Department who will commission a survey of the park to establish a base plan for future beautification and upgrades. Cllr Pappas added that the operation was coordinated from the Ward 31 councillors office and form part of the councillors 2019 plan to get open spaces looking better and clamping down on enforcement in the ward. “I would like to thank all the officials who have come together to assist with this initiative. “Without the buy in from the departments we would not be able to have organised interventions such as this,” said Cllr Pappas. Cllr Pappas urged residents to take civic pride in the suburb and to continuously strive to build one community for all. “I will try and have one of these operations every month in a different part of the ward: resources permitting,” said Cllr Pappas. Cllr Pappas claimed that departments and officials in the municipality are struggling with skills shortages, labour issues, budgets and political interference.  “As councillors and as a community, we need to rally behind those who still want eThekwini to succeed and drive out those who are destroying the city,” added Cllr Pappas. Comment from eThekwini Municipality was not forthcoming at the time of going to press.
