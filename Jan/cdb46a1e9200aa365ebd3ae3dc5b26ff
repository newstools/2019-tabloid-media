A quick-fix to solve the problem where sewage has been flowing into the Klipriver has become a cesspit. The Ladysmith Herald reported in the 15 January issue that raw sewage continued to flow into the Klipriver, a problem that has continued for months. The uThukela Municipality has since dug a hole next to the flowing river in an attempt to allow the effluent to flow into it. However, that has not remedied the problem but has caused it to become worse.
The river is a water source for the residents of the town and a frequented fishing spot. It is now polluted with waste. The bank between the pit and the river has also washed away with the hole overflowing with sewage that is flowing back into the river. Following the publishing of the article, neumerous calls were received from residents bitterly complaining about the problem and the fact that the municipality has done nothing to fix it. “The problem has been going on for more than six weeks,” said one caller.
