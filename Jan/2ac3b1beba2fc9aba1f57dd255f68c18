Armed gangs targeted Durban businesses in Westmead and Mayville and fled with cash, a computer and other valuables on Thursday night. Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios said a gang of four robbers, armed with knives and screwdrivers, arrived at a Durban business premises in Westmead and held up staff at around 6.50pm. “The gang arrived at the premises and pretended that they needed to enter the property to conduct work. An onsite security officer opened the gate for the vehicle and the suspects then jumped out and held him up at knifepoint,” Mathios said. “The gang forced the security officer into their vehicle and told him not to look at them. They then broke into a building on the premises and stole a computer and a CCTV camera screen. They shoved the security officer out of the vehicle before fleeing the scene,” Mathios said. In a separate incident, Mathios said four armed suspects targeted a business in Solomon Mahlangu Drive, in Rossburgh, and robbed staff of cash and cigarettes. “The suspects entered the premises and one of the gang members pulled out a firearm and held up a staff member. They grabbed cash and cigarettes and fled the scene on foot. It is unclear whether there was a getaway vehicle waiting for them nearby,” Mathios said. Mathios said two armed robbers also targeted a property in Vivien Road in Highlands Hills in the early hours of Friday morning at around 3am. “Two suspects, armed with knives, smashed a kitchen window to gain entry and ended up in a tussle with a resident. They demanded valuables and grabbed a wallet, a cellphone and the keys for a vehicle,” Mathios said. “The suspects unlocked the vehicle to make their getaway but then realised that the driveway gate was locked. They got out of the vehicle, jumped over the driveway gate and fled the scene on foot,” Mathios said.
