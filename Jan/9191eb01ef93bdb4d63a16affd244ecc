Phoenix police are investigating an armed robbery case where a complainant and his friend were robbed by three men wielding firearms on Wednesday night in the vicinity of Fernham and Bhambayi. Communications officer at Phoenix SAPS, Cpt L Naidoo, said, “The complainant alleges that he was dropping of his friend when three unknown males approached his vehicle. Two of the suspects had firearms and approached them from the driver’s side and passenger side whilst the third suspect stood behind the vehicle. The suspects demanded their cellphones and wallets at gunpoint. The passenger in the vehicle alighted from the vehicle and grabbed the suspect next to him. A struggle ensued. The suspect on the driver’s side then fired a shot in the air. The complainant’s friend released the suspect and backed down.
“The suspects robbed the victims of their belongings including a wallet with R30 cash and bank cards, a LG cellphone and a Hisense cellphone. No injuries were sustained by the victims,” said Cpt Naidoo.
Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said, “We urge community members to refrain from antagonising suspects when confronted with a weapon against you. Your life is worth more than material possessions. Try and remember as much about your attackers as you can and convey to the police. This will assist in rooting out the perpetrators quickly especially if they are linked to other crimes.
