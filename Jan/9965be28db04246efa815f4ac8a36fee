A new modus operandi has been noted by the eThekwini Outer South Cluster (EOS). Police said hijacked victims are conned by individuals purporting that money is required for vehicles to be released from the police pound. EOS communications officer, Captain Carmen Rhynes, said: “As the eThekwini Outer South Cluster we would like to stress that this is a scam. No one must give anyone money or deposit any cash for their vehicle to be released. The police pound does not request money to release a vehicle. Victims who encounter such a situation should report the matter to their nearest police station. Cases are being currently investigated and those responsible for this act will face criminal charges.” She said the modus operandi of the scammers is to pretend to be a police officer from a police stations or from the pound. “We want to warn the public to be aware of such a scam and not to make any deposits,” said Rhynes. Brigadier Vukani Mgobhozi, acting cluster commander of the eThekwini Outer South Cluster, said: “We will not allow further victimisation of victims of hijackings. This is a crime and will not be tolerated in our policing cluster. I urge all those who have information on these suspects, to come forward and report it to their nearest police station or on the Crime Stop number 08600 10111.”
