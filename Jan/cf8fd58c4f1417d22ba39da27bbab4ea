The Ladysmith High School once again held their traditional watermelon festival to kick start the new school year. Learners once again declared a messy watermelon war on each other as they attacked with hands full of watermelons. Some learners choose to enjoy the delicious treat with friends, while others launched a salvo of watermelons to leave a messy mark in a fun-filled afternoon.
