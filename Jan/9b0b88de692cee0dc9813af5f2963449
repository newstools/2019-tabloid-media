The Women in Business Achiever of the Year finalist for the month was awarded to Sandy Cipriano the founder of Cupakes of Hope during the first women in business event with Hirsch’s Ballito’s multi award winning businesswoman, Margaret Hirsch. Cupcakes of Hope is a non-profit company and a public benefit organisation with the aim to raise awareness and funds for families in need of medical assistance, and they do this through their love of baking cupcakes. Hirsch, who has won many awards over the years, commented on the reason behind her starting the Women in Business competition. “Winning these awards has been wonderful – both for Hirsch’s and for me personally, and I would like to see this happening to other women in business. As women, we tend not to be assertive enough. There are so many fantastic women out there who are not coming forward to be acknowledged for their contribution to the business world, and I would like to encourage them to come forward and enter the competition or nominate a friend or business owner who they would like to be recognised for this award. 
If you think you are a successful business woman don’t be too shy to enter yourself,” she said. Hirsch also spoke  about the importance of goal setting and showed the guests how to create their vision boards. “You can be like a bonsai tree and stay comfortable in your little pot or you can step out of your comfort zone and become a huge tree,” she said.
