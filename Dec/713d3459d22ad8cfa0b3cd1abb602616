The KZN Section of the Mountain Club of SA, received a call for help at 5pm on 7 December from the father of a hiker who fell while negotiating the chain ladders in the Monte-aux-Sources area of the northern Drakensberg.  A joint Mountain Club, SA Air Force, Ezemvelo Wildlife and Westline aviation carried out a rescue operation. “The father and his 32-year-old son were on a day hike to the popular Tugela Falls area. The accident happened while descending the well-known chain ladders. They had climbed down the first set of ladders to a rough ledge area. While clambering to the next and final set of ladders the hiker from Howick fell 25m to the bottom. His father had to run far down the mountain before cell communication was possible. It is probably the first ever serious accident on these ladders since their construction in the late 1960s,” said Gavin Raubenheimer, Mountain Club, KZN Search and Rescue convener The Mountain Club immediately activated a local paramedic,  also the Ezemvelo ranger, and an assistant rescue organiser,  were air lifted by private helicopter to a flat area above the patient. They then climbed down the ladders to give assistance.  The patient had multiple limb fractures and head injuries and was assisted through the night in cold conditions. Raubenheimer said that early on Sunday morning an Oryx helicopter from the South African Air Force’s 15 Squadron in Durban, flew with four technical rescuers on board. “A quick stop was made en route to pick up a vacuum mattress and heart monitor and then on to the accident scene. The MCSA members were then winched down to the patient, who was lying is a very narrow gully. After packaging the patient,  he was hoisted into the aircraft and flown to a hospital in Pietermaritzburg,” he said.
