The bereaved family of 71-year-old Abdul Kahlik who was hit by a stray bullet during a gang turf war shooting in 2016 can finally receive some semblance of closure after the three Phoenix men convicted of the pensioner’s murder were sentenced in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court, on Tuesday.The innocent and elderly Kahlik was cycling to mosque along Daleview Road and was struck by a bullet in the head when the three 18-year-old accused, identified as Sherizaad Lutchman, Terino King and Owen Naidoo, drove past and opened fire on an intended target. Kahlik was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his injury. The trio were found guilty in October. In handing down sentences, Lutchman received 18 years’ imprisonment for murder and attempted murder. Both King and Naidoo were handed down a higher sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment for murder, attempted murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of ammunition. The court heard contradictory testimonies from the three men which led to the guilty verdict. According to media reports, it was further revealed in court by the social worker, Thobile Sikhakhane, that Kahlik died “at the hands of young men of society who should be protecting elders”. She said imprisonment is considered as a suitable sentence as it balances aspects of deterrence punishment and rehabilitation. “The men are still young and can rehabilitate themselves to be better people in society,” Sikhakhane is reported to have said. Lutchman will be imprisoned and leaves behind a five-month-old baby and his wife. Sikhakhane told the court that according to Trevor King, father of Terino, his son was respectful but did things behind his back. Naidoo the sole breadwinner to his wife and child did not consider the consequences of his actions. The intended target was Tivone Augustine who said that Lutchman was the driver while King and Naidoo opened fire on him.
