It was an unusual and heartbreaking sight that confronted motorists on the R102/Inanda Road after a horse and taxi collided, leaving the equine dead and three people injured, on Sunday evening. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) was called to the scene by motorists who witnessed a fully laden taxi crash into a brown stallion. RUSA head, Prem Balram, said, “Upon arrival, Reaction Officers found an extensively damaged taxi on the northbound lane and a critically injured horse lying on the centre median. The Operations Centre made several unsuccessful attempts to contact a vet. The animal died a short while later. Two passengers and the rider sustained injuries and were treated on scene and transported to hospital.” He added, “The taxi had picked up passengers from a church in Amaoti and was headed towards Tongaat when it knocked into the animal. This was a senseless accident which should never have occurred. An innocent animal was killed in the process. We urge members of public and motorists to think clearly and act wisely when headed on the roads. In the blink of an eye, accidents can happen, and lives, whether human or animal, are snuffed out. Let us be safe on the roads this festive season,” said Balram.
