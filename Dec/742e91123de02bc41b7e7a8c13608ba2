The festive season has dawned and instead of feeling joyous, about 200 informal shacks will have to rebuild their lives after a fire razed their dwellings in Kenville last Tuesday. According to KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Services (EMS) spokesperson, Robert McKenzie, one person was reportedly treated for injuries sustained in the blaze. Ethekwini Municipality’s spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, said that the Municipality’s Disaster Management staff responded to an informal settlement fire in Gumtree Road, Kenville, Ward 34 which started at about lunch-time on Tuesday. “The Fire and Emergency Services extinguished the fire which was fanned by the strong winds, causing rapid fire spread. They estimated 150 structures and 200 people were affected. Disaster management are currently undertaking an assessment of the situation,” said Mayisela. He added,  the cause of the fire is still being investigated. Temporary shelter is being secured and procedures are in place to assist the affected persons. Disaster Management officials  Zamani Mtshali and Themba Mdalose, who were on site, contacted Darul Ihsan Humanitarian Centre with a requisition for blankets. The Relief team delivered 100 blankets to the site.
