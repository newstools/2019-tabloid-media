A fatal truck crash claimed the life of a truck driver and left a passenger fighting for his life on the M7 joining the Umbilo arterial road in Umbilo on Tuesday morning. Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find a truck on its side blocking the entire roadway. Garrith Jamieson, spokesperson  for Rescure Care Paramedics said: “Paramedics found both the driver and passenger severely entrapped in the wreckage. “The Netcare 911 rescue unit as well as the Durban Fire Department were called to assist with rescue tools. The patients were freed using the jaws of life and other hydraulic equipment. The driver had sustained major injuries and unfortunately there was nothing paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased at the scene.” “The passenger had sustained serious injuries and once freed from the wreckage, was stabilised by Advanced Life Support paramedics before being transported to hospital for the further care that he required. The roadway was blocked for some time during the recovery,” added Jamieson. He said, “At this stage, the events leading up to the crash are unknown however, SAPS were on the scene and will be investigating further.”
