The Westville Community Policing Forum (CPF) together with the Westville Safety Net Team were visible on Sunday, at  Westwood Mall, interacting with shoppers to be more proactive against gender-based violence and educating people to break the silence. Pamphlets outlining the signs to look for, the numbers to contact and ways to help someone who is oppressed by gender -based violence were handed out. According to the Westville CPF chairperson Asad Patel, this was an opportunity to meet and greet the members as well raise funds for the CPF by running a raffle at the mall. “The programme was well supported by the community,” he said.
