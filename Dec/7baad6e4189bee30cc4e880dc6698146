The eThekwini municipality, has assured residents that they will be tightening security at all their reservoirs, following a gruesome discovery of human remains inside one of the water compartments in Verulam, last Friday. The skeletal remains were discovered by a municipal worker when he was doing a routine check on the water supply. The gruesome discovery raised concerns from residents and municipal authorities, about the safety of reservoirs. According to reports, the lock of the security gate to that particular section of the reservoir had been broken, for a while. The damage done to the lock did not however raise suspicion with municipal workers, who were regularly monitoring the water supply. Residents from the catchment area, of the water supply, have claimed to be suffering from waterborne diseases like irritable rashes and respiratory problems. This, despite the reservoir being drained and chemically treated. The municipality has assured residents that the water from the reservoir’s other compartment is safe to drink. Thanduxolo Sabelo, eThekwini Infrastructure and Human Settlements Committee Chairperson, said the city was working around the clock to add security to all its reservoirs and to ensure the safety of water. He said:”We are going to deploy security personnel and install CCTV cameras in all our reservoirs. We aim to avoid a repetition of such incidents.” The police have sent the remains for analysis, for possible identification as well as to determine the cause of death and date of death. Sthembiso Ngema, Democratic Alliance councillor in the Portfolio for Infrastructure and Human Settlements, said municipal authorities must ensure that reservoirs are secured day and night. He said: “If we continue this way, someone can walk in our reservoirs and pour dangerous poison. We need to take full responsibility to keep water compartments safe.”
