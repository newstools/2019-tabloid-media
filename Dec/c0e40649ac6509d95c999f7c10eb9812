On the brink of break-up day, more than a hundred pupils from Quarry Heights Primary School were treated to a fun and informative morning hosted by SAPS Greenwood Park, on Wednesday, 4 December. SAPS were joined by the Independent Crisis Team, Big Five Panel and Paint and motivational speaker Thulani Zulu, where they all emphasised the importance of pupils knowing their rights. The principal of Quarry Heights Primary School Ntombi Madlala, said that the programme was a necessary initiative as pupils would be going on holiday and will become vulnerable. “Our pupils come from a community where gender-based violence is imminent, so we requested that Greenwood Park SAPS host this programme to make them aware of their rights and their responsibility. We believe that prevention is better than cure, teaching them before anything happens will help them become wiser,” said Mdalala. Members from SAPS divulged into the topic of drug abuse, bullying, human trafficking, preventative methods during the holidays and how to report matters to the police. “Many times there are cases of gender-based violence but individuals don’t report them.  This is why we try to do awareness campaigns so that individuals will be more encouraged to stand up for themselves and report matters. We also hope to change the mindset of people in the community who think that they can just abuse individuals without being punished,” said Captain Jerome Slater, communications officer at Greenwood Park SAPS. The primary school pupils treated guests to a special Indian inspired dance routine and a song. Sponsors of the initiative Big Five Panel and Paint, ended off the programme by giving pupils tasty snacks as well as sanitary pads for the females. “We do community initiatives throughout the year and this year, we decided to partner with Greenwood Park SAPS. We are so grateful that we could be a part of this important event,” said Tristelle Pillay.
