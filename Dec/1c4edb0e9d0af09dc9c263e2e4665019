South African YouTube sensation and local wildlife enthusiast, Dingo Dinkelman visited Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh recently, where he was filming for his upcoming YouTube series, ‘World’s Most Dangerous Snakes’.   One of the snakes included in the series will be a Black Mamba which was Crocworld Conservation Centre’s captive specimen used for filming in one of the episodes. The snake expert brought a Coastal Taipan, considered to be the third most venomous snake on earth.  “It was great having Dingo back at Crocworld conservation centre and such an awesome opportunity to work with the Coastal Taipan,” said Martin Rodrigues, the centre manager of Crocworld Conservation Centre. “Neither myself, nor James Wittstock (Crocworld Reptile Curator) have had the opportunity to handle this specific snake before, although we have previously worked with the Papua New Guinea Taipan,” said Rodrigues. Dingo grew up in nature, with his father in the employ of the Parks Board, he had the opportunity to engage with wildlife a little more than most. After working for just over a decade as a life and investment broker, he followed his passion back into the wild five years ago, getting involved in the conservation of endangered species, anti-poaching campaigns and dangerous rescues.  “There is something intrinsically good about being in nature, and I believe that if we can create and foster a love for animals and our natural world in people now, we can make a long-term difference to conservation,” said Dinkelman. He is currently shooting his latest YouTube series which focuses on the globe’s 10 most dangerous snakes.
