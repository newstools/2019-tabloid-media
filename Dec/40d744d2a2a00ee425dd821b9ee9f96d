Ahead of the festive season‚ the Department of Transport has announced that it is considering a number of proposed changes to South Africa’s traffic laws. However, the department stressed that the changes will not be imminent and all due processes will be followed. One of the laws under review is that of drinking and driving, and the acceptable limit of alcohol in ones system, while behind the steering wheel. Currently the legal limit is a breath-alcohol content of 0.24mg per 1000ml‚ or a blood alcohol limit of 0.05g per 100ml. As defined by the government, moderate alcohol consumption is no more than two standard drinks, 340ml or a half quart of beer per day for women and no more than three standard drinks per day for men. This equals to two thirds of a beer or spirit cooler with 5% alcohol content, for wine drinkers, 75ml of red or white wine per hour with an alcohol content of 12% to 14% and for spirit drinkers one 25ml tot of alcohol per hour is acceptable. The new proposal is to drop the legal blood-alcohol level to zero percent, meaning that drivers will not be allowed to drink alcohol and drive at all. The National Road Traffic Act (NRA) differentiates between normal drivers and professional drivers, drivers with a professional driving permits. The NRA says for normal drivers, the concentration of alcohol in any blood specimen must be less than 0.05 gram per 100 millilitres, and in the case of a professional driver, less than 0.02 gram per 100 millilitres. Department spokesperson, Ayanda Allie Paine said: “If given the green light, the new proposals will become part of the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) system which establishes a new demerit system.” According to department statistics, a total of 8 507 motorists were arrested during the 2018/19 festive season, from 1 December 2018 to 8 January 2019. Out of that figure 2 223 motorists were arrested for drunk driving and 775 for speeding.
