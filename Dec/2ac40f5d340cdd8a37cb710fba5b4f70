The Kloof and Highway SPCA will be hosting its annual Christmas Fair on Saturday, 7 Dec from 8am-1pm and the community is invited for a fun filled shopping experience. SPCA manager, Barbara Patric said all the charity shops will be open, including the popular Christmas Shop located at the Attic, and all will be stocked with the best bargains. “Father Christmas will be stopping by Marilyn’s Tea House at 11am and his special visit is not to be missed by the kiddies. The gift bags for Father Christmas visit will be on sale from 8am to 10.45am for parents to buy. As part of entertainment on the day, there will be live singing in the garden and Marilyn’s Tea House will be serving the most delicious food. “There is loads of entertainment for the children including five jungle gyms, the Centipede Cycle Track, and a soft play area for the tiny tots. We hope to see you there,” Patric said.
