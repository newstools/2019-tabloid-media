Philisiwe Xaba This year taught me to be patient, to have faith and to only believe in myself. Nonhlanlan Sibeku I tried to be the very best of me, and taught me to love myself and my fellow African residents, depsite colour, culture and race. I will be taking this lesson into the New Year. Max Pillay It taught me that at my age I could fall in love, again. Fiona Juan I broke all the rules in 2019. The one thing that I was taught was that you have to do things, that you cannot do so that those things can be done.
