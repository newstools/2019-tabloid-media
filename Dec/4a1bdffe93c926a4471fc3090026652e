The community of Kharwastan and Umhlathuzana have been left fuming at the state of disrepair of a road that collapsed during the Easter floods, in April. Seven months later, the residents say they still waiting on the municipality to repair the busy, Heron Street. Dan Naicker, a resident in the area, said he struggles to get to and from work, using the road that has a section reduced to one lane. “It’s nightmare to use that road, especially at night. The barriers have fallen and nobody has bothered to even start with the repair work,” he said. Naicker, like other residents said he has been in touch with both the councillor and municipality, as more rains are expected. “Its getting worse each time it rains. Its not like they don’t know about, this happened in Easter and here we are. The recent heavy rains have made it worse,” Pillay added. The ward 65 Councillor, Samantha Magdalene Windvogel, said she had numerous attempts to get the municipality to do the much needed repairs. However her efforts have proven to be fruitless. Windgovel said: “It is extremely upsetting and quiet frustrating for the residents to have to endure such poor service delivery. Residents have to fear that every time it rains, the road will collapse or whilst drive along the road it will collapse. This municipality has been dragging their feet with this matter for the last eight months now. It is an accident waiting to happen. All I get is we awaiting signatures.” Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said.
