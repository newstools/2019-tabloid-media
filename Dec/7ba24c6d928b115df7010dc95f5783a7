Glenmore Primary and Durban Primary Schools have started with their tree decorations on Helen Joseph Road in Umbilo. The last year’s winners wrapped and hung ornaments on their trees and labelled them over the weekend, starting off a challenge for other schools in the area. Bulwer Safety and Urban Regeneration Forum and Umbilo Community Policing Forum chairperson, Heather Rorick said more schools, businesses, families and organisations are still welcome to adopt a tree to decorate for the competition on behalf of a school. She said the turn out for this year’s competition is not as good as last year, however, she is still hoping that more people are still going to come through. “The aim of this competition is to make our area bright and colourful during the festive season. Helen Joseph is one of our most visited streets and having all the trees decorated would really make it look welcoming to the motorists and road users going up and down that road. It creates a beautiful Christmas atmosphere,” said Rorick.She said those who still want to participate can contact Heather Rorick on 062 267 6535.
