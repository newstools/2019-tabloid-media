SerendiPitty Rescue (Pitbull) will be hosting Bark in the Park at Westville Athletics Club on Sunday, 15 December from 10am to 5pm. Organiser and co-owner of SerendiPitty, Mandy Burneister said, the aim of the event is to raise awareness and funds for Serendipitty who assists with adoptions and care for unwanted Pitbull’s. “All dogs are welcome on condition that they are on a harness and are socialised,” she said.“SerendiPitty Rescue is a no-kill dog rescue organisation dedicated and committed to rescue, protect and improve the lives of abused, abandoned and homeless Pit Bull dogs. Following a comprehensive adoption process, we place our dogs in loving, responsible and safe homes, with families who are passionate about dogs and have a clear understanding of the breed.  “We are committed to providing the dogs that come to SerendiPitty Rescue with the best possible veterinary care and treatment as well as ensuring they are all sterilised before being placed in their new homes,” added Burneister. She said that the rescue organisation relies solely on donations from the community. On the day of the event, there will be a number of stalls, a dog trainer and loads of entertainment. Tickets will be available at the entrance to the club at a cost of R50 for adults and R25 for children under 12 years. Burneister said with so much on offer, own food and drink will not be permitted at the venue. “Don’t forget to bring your picnic blanket and make a day of it with your four legged and two legged family and friends for a fun family day out in celebration of this amazing breed of dog,” she concluded.
