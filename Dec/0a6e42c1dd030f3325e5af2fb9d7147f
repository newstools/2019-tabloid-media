Rotarians are members of neighbourhoods and community members uniting for the common good. Their mandate is servicing the community, in the workplace and throughout the world. Rotarians develop community service projects that address many of today’s most critical issues, supporting programs for the youth, educational opportunities and international exchanges for students, teachers and other professionals, and vocational and career development. The Rotary motto is “Service Above Self”. Abiding to the mandate, the Rotary Club of Westville recently did a grocery collection at the Westville Super Spar and Pick n Pay Village Market, to make hampers for the less fortunate. President Sue Walker has been a rotarian for five years and says, the grocery collection is an annual programme for the rotary, and is greatly supported by the store mangers and staff. “From our collection on 29 and 30 November we were able to distribute 65 hampers to the less fortunate and the balance was donated to the Robin Hood Foundation who will be distributing to its beneficiaries to warm their hearts.” Walker said there are so many people who are disadvantaged and by giving what we can, especially over the Christmas period, gives them hope and reassures them that someone out there cares for them and loves them.”
