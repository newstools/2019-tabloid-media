The community of Umbilo is invited to yet another Bulwer Safety and Urban Regeneration Forum’s (BSURF) community Christmas Flea Market on Saturday, 14 December. The market will take place in front of the Bulwer Children’s Park on Bulwer Road, from 10am to 4pm. BSURF chairperson, Heather Rorick said that stall holders are invited to book a stall, however, each stall holder should provide their own tables and chairs and umbrella or gazeebo if needed. “Last year’s flea market was very successful and we urge the community to come out in numbers. We will have a variety of stalls and father Christmas will be making his entrance to hand out treats to the children and have photos taken,” she added.
