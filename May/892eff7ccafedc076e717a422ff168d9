A Phoenix resident’s bathroom break during the early hours of the morning turned into a living nightmare when she was accosted by two suspects, assaulted and robbed, on Tuesday. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, said, “The complainant woke up to use bathroom when she suddenly noticed the light shining in the passage. She ran and locked herself in her bedroom and pressed the panic button. The suspects kicked the door open, assaulted the victim with their fists and ordered her to switch off the alarm.” Cpt Naidoo said the suspects ransacked the house and took a 67 inch Telefunken TV, a gold chain, R800, two handbags and a hair iron valued at R3, 000. The suspects fled on foot. It was determined that the suspects gained entry by damaging the front sliding door and cutting the burglar guard. Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said, “We urge residents to be alert and vigilant. Neighbours are implored to watch out for each other as well. Criminals are merciless and are out to gain whatever they want through brazen violence and criminality.”
