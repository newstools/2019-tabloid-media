Criminals have once again trampled on holy ground when they broke into a container at the Shree Ganesha Temple Society on Palmview Drive, last week and fled with sound equipment, brass pots and religious attire. Chairman of the temple, Dennis Govender, told The Phoenix Tabloid that devotees and himself are distraught at the horrible act of criminality.“We are so perturbed that human beings out there saw fit to break into a premises on the temple grounds and steal items that are much needed by the temple. These criminals stole two sets of sound system complete with speakers and amplifier, cables and all the fittings. They also took a video machine, brass pots, saries and dhotis. We are appealing to pawn brokers and community members in the suburb to please be alert and inform us if any of the stolen items have been spotted. “We have reported the theft to Phoenix SAPS and we urge any persons with information to come forward and inform the police or myself and we will investigate further,” said Govender.
