Two separate collisions on the M7 in Pinetown in the early hours of Monday morning left two people dead and five others with various injuries. Operations director at Rescue Care, Garrith Jamieson, said, “Rescue Care paramedics responded to the M7 over the M13 Bridge around 3am for a collision involving two vehicles. On arrival, they found the two badly damaged vehicles in the junction. On assessment, it was established that one passenger believed to be in his 60s had sustained major injuries. There was nothing more paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased on the scene. Three others were stabilised on the scene before being transported to nearby hospitals for the further care that they required.” In a second crash, just after 5am, Rescue Care paramedics responded to the M7 near the N3 interchange. “On arrival, they found that a single vehicle carrying a load of bread had overturned coming to rest on its side. The driver, a male, believed to be in his 30s, had sustained major injuries and there was nothing more paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased on the scene. Two passengers had sustained serious injuries and were stabilised by Advanced Life Support Paramedics before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that they required,” said Jamieson. He added that the events leading up to the collisions are unknown and SAPS will be investigating further.
