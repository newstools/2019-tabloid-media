Acting chairman of the hospital board at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital (MGMH), Pastor Mervyn Reddy, is urging patients and community members to remain calm in light of the grisly discovery of a man’s decomposed body in the ceiling of the hospital’s trauma unit, earlier today. Speaking
to the Phoenix Tabloid, Reddy said, “Intense investigations
are underway to determine whether the decomposed corpse of the man believed to
be about 35-years-old that was found in the ceiling is that of a patient. That
will take some time to establish. There are concerns of negligence that have
since emerged from the public but I want to reassure patients and the Phoenix
community that Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital is functioning as normal. There
is no need to panic. This tragic incident does not compromise the service
delivery provided by this health care facility and does not prove that there
was any negligence on the part of the hospital. Let us not create animosity but
rather await the facts in this case,” said Reddy. Phoenix
SAPS communications officer Cpt L Naidoo said, “An inquest is being
investigated at Mahatma Gandhi Hospital where it is alleged that the body of an
African male was found trapped in the ceiling. His body was decomposed. It is
suspected that the deceased was trying to escape from hospital. Members from
the SAPS Search and Rescue unit were dispatched to retrieve the body.”
