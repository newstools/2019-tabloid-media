Ward 31 Councillor Christopher Pappas casted his voted on Tuesday, 7 May as a special voter at Norwegian Hall in Musgrave. The doors were opened for those registered for special voting before the national voting day on Wednesday. Papas said,” As South Africans we must hold government accountable.  We have a choice between what we have right now, and the alternative to accept what is laid in the table. We also have a choice to reward corruption, or to punish it. I hope South Africans realise their power in the vote and use it to hold politicians accountable.” When asked the difference between voting in 1994 and 2019, Pappas said,” Back then our vote was different, we voted for freedom and today we are voting for a government that will be able to deliver on that freedom.
