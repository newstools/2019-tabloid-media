An Overport family has been plunged into the throes of mourning after their 56-year-old husband and father, identified as Wasim Joseph Scott, was shot dead outside their flat on West Road on Monday morning. Police are probing the circumstances surrounding the mystery killing. PRO for eThekwini Secure, an organisation that is at the forefront of the fight against crime, Zain Soosiwala, condemned the horrendous and senseless act.“Members of eThekwini Secure received a call for help on our Zello channel to dispatch emergency services and patrollers for a possible drive-by shooting in the West Road area of Overport. The eThekwini Secure patrollers arrived first on the scene and quickly secured the area where they found the victim dead with a single gunshot wound to the head. “It was discovered that the victim was approached by a man known to him and after a discussion ensued, the person opened fire and shot the man with a single bullet to the head. When the victim’s son arrived at the scene, he confirmed that his father was on his way to work. “EThekwini Secure members enquired if anyone witnessed anything, however, there were no witnesses that could come forth at the time, except for one person who said that she saw a black car parked in the driveway,” said Soosiwala. He added, “Questions will remain, but the motive behind the incident is currently being investigated by SAPS. We encourage any witness to please contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
