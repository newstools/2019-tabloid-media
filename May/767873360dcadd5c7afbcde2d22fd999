It was a crime stint cut short for two suspects who were nabbed after one was spotted fleeing from a property in Morningside in the early hours of Saturday morning, whilst the second suspect was later arrested when he was found still hiding on the premises. Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios said an armed response officer had responded to an alarm activation at the premises when he saw the suspect running out of the property. The incident occurred at around 1.10am. “He managed to apprehend the suspect and asked him what he was doing on the premises. The suspect responded that he was looking for a place to sleep. The officer handcuffed the suspect and called for backup to the scene,” he said. “When the backup officers arrived at the scene they searched the premises and found that one of the doors had been opened. There was no one living on the property as it is currently undergoing renovations,” he said. “While inspecting outside the building, the officers found a second suspect who was hiding behind a retaining wall. The first suspect claimed that he did not know the second suspect who had joined him to find a place to sleep on the premises,” Mathios said. Mathios said it appeared that nothing had been stolen from 
the premises. “The first suspect that was arrested was in the possession of an Okapi knife. Both suspects were handed over to the Berea SAPS at the scene of the crime,” he said. Mathios commended the officers for their team work and swift response to the premises that led to the arrests. “Our officer’s quick response time to the scene of the alarm activation and his swift reaction to apprehend the fleeing suspect is to be commended, as is the team’s thorough inspection of the premises that led to the second arrest.”
