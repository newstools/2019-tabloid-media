A pedestrian was fatally rammed when a vehicle overturned and two men were seen fleeing the scene on foot on the M25 near KwaMashu, on Thursday night. Police also seized two unlicensed firearms from the crashed vehicle which was abandoned by the suspects. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) members responded to the scene whilst on patrol in the area. “At approximately 7:44pm, two men were seen fleeing the scene of the accident on foot. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa were on patrol in the area and stopped after they noticed a Toyota Etios lying on its roof. The mutilated body of an identified man was found lying in the path of traffic. He was dragged several meters from the point of impact. “Upon arrival of police, the vehicle was searched and one firearm was recovered under the driver’s seat. A second firearm was recovered under the spare tyre. The serial numbers on both pistols were filed off,” said RUSA head, Prem Balram. “A registration check was conducted and confirmed that the vehicle was not sought after, however, the number plates used by the suspects are believed to be cloned. It is believed that the occupants of the vehicle may be linked to a syndicate that is being sought for a home invasion. Police are investigating further,” added Balram. Police spokesperson, Cpt Nqobile Gwala, said, “A case of culpable homicide was opened at the Phoenix police station for investigation after a body of an unknown male was found dead on the M25 highway near the crossroads on 2 May 2019 at 7:50pm.”
