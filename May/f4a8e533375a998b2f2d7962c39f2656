Tongaat residents recently assembled for a day of safety lessons. Nick Evans, who represented the KwaZulu-Natal Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, frightened and excited attendants when he approached the podium with a snake in hand.Evans, whose address was based on snakes, spoke about the safety tips on handling snakes and the dangers of mishandling the venomous reptile. “Snakes are normal animals like others, so we need to conserve them. However, they are dangerous to a person who does not know how to handle them,” he said.
