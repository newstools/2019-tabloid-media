Reaction officers from Phoenix security company, KZN VIP, were confronted with a gruesome sight when they broke the door of a burning house and found the scorched remains of a woman inside the bloodstained Stonebridge Drive property earlier today. Speaking to the Phoenix Tabloid, KZN VIP spokesman, Gareth Naidoo, said his reaction and medical teams quickly responded to the scene after receiving a call about a house on fire. “Upon arrival on scene, my reaction teams discovered that the house was closed up but black smoke was filling up inside the premises. The door was broken down to locate the source of the fire and immediately extinguish it. The house inside appeared to have been ransacked as items were scattered about on the floor and this sparked the team’s suspicions,” said Naidoo. “A further inspection of the house revealed blood stains and the body of a woman who was burnt to death in one of the bedrooms,” Naidoo added. He said the scene was handed over to police who are investigating the case
