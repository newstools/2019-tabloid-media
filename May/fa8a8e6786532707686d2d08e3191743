The Child Welfare Chatsworth Charity Fair is the perfect place to spoil mums this Mother’s Day weekend with non-stop fun, food, shopping and entertainment for young and old. The Chatsworth Tabloid Pic-A-Box show brought to you by courtesy of Tabloid Newspapers will be a major draw card and it has everything in it for the whole family. Entrants stand a chance to win fantastic prizes worth over R20 000 in the competition that takes place on Sunday at 4pm. All interested participants are required to fill in the entry form and drop it off at the Chatsworth Tabloid stall to stand a chance to win one of the many prizes up for grabs. Tabloid Newspapers regional sales manager Sash Govender said: “It is indeed a pleasure for the Chatsworth Tabloid to be media partners for the Chatsworth Child Welfare Charity Fair for the fourth year in a row. This partnership is a worthwhile initiative operating with a purpose close to our hearts. So bring the whole family to the fair this weekend and please make sure to stop at our stall and meet our team.”
