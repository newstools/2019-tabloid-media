A three-year-old toddler tragically drowned after falling into a pool at his home in Mariannhill on the afternoon of 15 May. Netcare 911’s Shawn Herbst said the incident occurred in Holzner Avenue. “Neighbours heard the splashing and cry for help and went to investigate, when they saw the child submerged in the pool. “The neighbour jumped the fence to rescue the child. When paramedics arrived on the scene, CPR had already been initiated by the neighbour. A full advanced life support resuscitation was initiated on takeover and a pulse successfully regained. Unfortunately the boy passed away in hospital a short while later,” said Herbst.
