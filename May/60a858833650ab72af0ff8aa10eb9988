A horrific collision on the M7 east bound under the N2 bridge claimed the life of one man and left three others injured on Saturday morning. Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find carnage. Operations director at Rescue Care, Garrith Jamieson, said, “It is alleged that a truck somehow lost control and ploughed into stationary vehicles at the intersection before it collided into the pillar. The impact was so severe that the trucks engine landed some distance from the truck. “The driver was found ejected with multiple critical injuries and the Lenmed 1 Aeromedical Helicopter was called in to rapidly transport the man to a nearby hospital. Two passengers in the truck were found entrapped in the wreckage and the Durban Fire Department worked to free them. “Unfortunately, one man had sustained major injuries and he was declared deceased on the scene. The second passenger was placed on a manual ventilator before being transported to a nearby hospital for further care. “One of the vehicle drivers had also sustained minor injuries as a result of the collision. “The events leading up to the collision are unknown, however, SAPS were on the scene and will be investigating further,” added Jamieson.
