Police are working to establish the identity of an alleged hijacker who was fatally shot by his accomplice during a hijacking in progress on Berea Road, on Friday night. The deceased man, believed to be in his 20s, was killed after he was shot in the chest near the Caltex Garage on Berea Road. provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said, “It is alleged that on Friday, a taxi was carrying three passengers; one in the front seat and two at the back. Whilst on Berea 
Road, they pointed a driver with firearms and demanded to take his vehicle. “The driver fought the suspects and whilst fighting, the suspects accidentally shot the one of their own. The suspect died on the scene inside the vehicle with one gunshot wound on the chest. The other two suspects then fled the scene. The driver did not sustain any visible injuries.  The deceased is still unidentified.”  Rescue Care operations director, Garrith Jamieson, said, “Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find that two men had been shot in what is believed to be a hijacking incident. One man was assessed and found to have sustained a fatal gunshot wound to his chest and was declared deceased on the scene. “The second man was also shot in the upper body and was stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required.”
