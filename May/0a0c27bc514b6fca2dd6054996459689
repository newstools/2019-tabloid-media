The DA has recently appointed Councillor Nicole Graham as the caretaker for Ward 31 until the IEC announces the date of the by-elections. Graham is the DA caucus leader in the eThekwini council and has been working with different wards. She said her appointment may be a bit of challenge, however, with the experience of being a ward councillor since 2011, to get anything done she will need the assistance of the community during this period. “My plate is quite full and having the responsibility of my own ward, it may be a challenge. I have been a ward councillor for Ward 33 which neighbours Ward 31, I am familiar with the community but not as its ward councillor,” said Graham. She said her primary responsibility at the moment is to lead the DA in eThekwini and to serve on the city’s executive. Graham will be available on the ward’s email address ward31@ethekwini.org and on her personal email nicolegraham@gamil.com for all communication and will respond accordingly. Former Ward Councillor Christopher Pappas said that he was confident that he was leaving the ward in capable hands. “Councillor  Hassan Haniff of Ward 25 is also very productive and is willing to assist. ANC, Al Jama, TA, and EFF proportional representative councillors deployed to the area for the past three years have the same powers to assist with service delivery issues in the ward,” Pappas said.
