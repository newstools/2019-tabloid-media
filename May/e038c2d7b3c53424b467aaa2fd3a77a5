As millions of South Africans cast their votes today, yesterday saw special votes being cast. Among those casting their special vote on Tuesday morning was Abdul Wahab and Fazila Mahomed from Road 503, Croftdene, at the Astra Primary School. Muslims were allowed to apply for special votes in light of the start of the month long Ramadaan fast on Tuesday, 8 May. 
The special voting arrangement was also afforded to the elderly, the ill or those who were unable to go to one of the stations on voting day. “We are quite happy,” said the Mahomeds. “We are grateful for the privilege of the special vote during our holy month of Ramadaan. We are voting for a better life and a change for the better in our country.”
