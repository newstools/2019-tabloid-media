Glenwood High Schools U16A and first XV team were so fortunate to get assistance from former Springbok player, Heinke van der Merwe with scrum drills recently. During his visit to SA, van der Merwe was willing to take some of his time and spent it with the boys and sharing his knowledge with them. Van der Merweâ€™s first tour with the Springboks was to France, Italy, Ireland, and England in late 2009 where he played in one test and two touring matches. In June 2010, van der Merwe joined Leinster on a two-year contract, replacing CJ van der Linde at the province. In November 2012, van der Merwe was called up to the South African squad for their European tour, due to injury cover. He joined Stade Francais for the 2013/14 season and is currently still playing for them. The school extends its gratitude to him for his time and interest in the boys.
